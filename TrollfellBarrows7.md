# Trollfell Barrows

## 7: Barrow of Aznadrad (Azruun Witch-King)

_Occupied and intact_

After the overthrow of Narastur and his Circle of Seven, Aznadrad, the commander of the fortress of Azkruthul, set out to gather up as much of his former master’s power as he could. Several surviving apprentices of the Circle rallied together under his leadership and began again to advance in the practice of their dark arts. They became known as the Red Mages, for the sanguine color of their robes. Aznadrad acqured several pages of the Codex of Naurastur and grew mighty in necromancy. He took mastery over the Red Mages and bent the evil creatures of the region to his will. Azkruthul became a place of dread and its ruler came to be called the Witch King.

Already advanced in years and with so many schemes yet to accomplish, the Witch-King was intrigued by the path to immortality offered by one of the Codex manuscripts. He prevailed on the Red Mages to assist him in his research. When all preparations were ready, the diabolists performed the thrice-damned ritual that transformed Aznadrad into a lich and then joined their master in undeath. Deranged by the transformation, Aznadrad withdrew to the tomb that had been prepared for him. Together, he and his followers built arcane structures and cast further rituals from the Codex manuscripts that drew Aznadrad’s barrow into the sphere of Thanos. As the sinking of a ship may pull swimmers down with it, this extrusion of the mortal world into Shadow dragged the surrounding area, including the barrows of Nethruzal and Melanzarad, into the realm of Cymmyrion.

Seeking to collect the scattered pages of the Codex, Aznadrad sent the Red Mages out into the great cities of the world, where they put together an underground network of scholars, sages and wizards to funnel ancient lore and manuscripts to their master. Guided by hints and hidden clues thus obtained, Aznadrad gleaned secrets from the dark spaces between the stars -- secrets that mortals were not meant to know. Obsessed now with otherworldly matters, Aznadrad abdicated his rule of Azkruthul. The fortress fell into neglect, as did the enchantments of concealment that the lich had placed in the Barrow Valley.

In his search for the Codex, Aznadrad unintentionally created a market for antiquities, which led to the formation of bands of adventurers to seek out such items. Ironically, some of these eventually traced clues in ancient texts to the Trollfell barrows and mounted expeditions to plunder them.

Through this means, Pentalya learned of the barrows and the powerful secrets they might contain. She located Aznadrad’s tomb, but finding that the place was still the lair of such a terrible occupant, the hag wisely left it alone. She set spies recruited from Blightland to watch the crossings between worlds and settled in among the ruins of Azkruthul.

Over the centuries, Aznadrad made significant modifications to his barrow to further his research, including structures designed to channel arcane energy, portals to distant locations and chambers that exist in other dimensions. After incursions from treasure-seekers became a nuisance, the Witch-King built cunning traps and placed unsleeping guardians in the initial levels of the barrow. These tend to be deadly, but obvious, as Aznadrad is motivated by the desire to ward off distractions rather than the blind hatred of the living or the need to feed on their life-energy typical of other kinds of undead.

### Exterior

Aznadrad had many years and considerable resources to complete his burial-site. Its architecture, materials and construction reflect his arrogation of regal status. Far from a simple barrow, it is a tomb designed to impress viewers with the Witch-King’s prestige and necromantic might.

Nestled on a terrace in the face of a high cliff of obsidian, Aznadrad’s tomb-mound rises in three oblong tiers 15 feet high fronted by massive blocks of black basalt. On the top tier stands a round tower some 30 feet high built of smaller blocks of the same material and capped with a black dome. A broad colonnade stands on a courtyard before the entrance. At the center of the courtyard is a pool fed by a spring of dark water that runs off into a channel and spills over the edge of a cliff into a basin 150 feet below. The base of the waterfall gives off a spray of necrotic energy. The waterfall and the bottom of the basin are covered with bluish-purple crystals that grow two-foot spikes. These somehow amplify harmonic vibrations from the the roar of the waterfall to produce an undertone of an deep, unearthly frequency. A narrow staircase cut in stone winds into the cliff on the left side of the waterfall, but it is concealed by a face of the cliff until the observer stands at the base of the waterfall. Each of these features constitutes a hazard for the unwary:

### Waterfall Base

The crystals at the base of the waterfall vibrate with a necrotic frequency that affects the spirits of creatures that start their turns within 20 squares of the base of the waterfall:

Black Noise (Level 14 Obstacle)

Hazard XP 4,150

The crystals at the base of the waterfall thrum an unearthly undertone to the throb of dark water crashing down to the basin. The drone seems to call your very spirit down a dark tunnel to sweet oblivion.

Hazard: This sonorous noise draws the life-force of creatures hearing it into the sphere of shadow.

Perception  
- It takes no check to hear the noise. 

Additional Skill: Arcana  
- DC 24: The character recognizes the life-draining traits of the sound.  

Trigger  
When a living creature starts its turn in hearing of the noise, the sound makes the following attack.

Attack: Necrotic, Psychic  
Opportunity Action Area the entire area covered by the sound  
Target: Each living creature that starts its turn in the area of sound  
Attack: +15 vs. Fortitude  
Hit: The target is slowed and grants combat advantage (save ends both). First Failed Saving Throw: The target instead falls unconscious (save ends). Second Failed Saving Throw: The target drops to zero hit points and is dying.  

Countermeasures  
- Deafened creatures are immune to the effects of the sound.  
- If a creature uses earplugs or similar devices the sound attacks at a -5 penalty and the creature gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against the sound’s effects.  
- Bard utility spells such as Song of Courage and Song of Defense nullify the sound in the affected squares until the end of the caster’s next turn (or, in the case of a zone, until the zone ends). Those who start their turns in nullified areas are not attacked.  

The area for 10 squares around the base of the waterfall, vertically and horizontally, is filled with a necrotic mist that affects creatures that start their turns in the area:

Life Eater Mist (Level 22 Obstacle)

Hazard XP 4,150

A spray of blue-tinted mist pervades the area at the base of the dark waterfall. Each gasp of the vile stuff drains your strength and saps your life essence.

Hazard: This strange mist steals the life from those within it.

Perception  
- It takes no check to see the gas.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
- DC 24: The character recognizes the life-draining traits of the haze.

Trigger  
When a living creature starts its turn in the gas, the gas makes the following attack.

Attack: Necrotic, Poison  
Opportunity Action Area the entire area covered by the mist  
Target: Each living creature that starts its turn in the mist  
Attack: +23 vs. Fortitude  
Hit: 1d10 + 6 poison damage, and ongoing 10 necrotic damage (save ends). First Failed Saving Throw: The ongoing damage increases to 15 necrotic. Second Failed Saving Throw: The target loses a healing surge.  

Countermeasures  
- Making a close or an area attack that has the radiant keyword nullifies the haze in the affected squares until the end of the attacker's next turn (or, in the case of a zone, until the zone ends). Those who start their turns in nullified areas are not attacked.

### Steep Stairway

A stairway carved into the obsidian cliff face leads up to the head of the waterfall. On the inside walls of the stairway, a border of Azruun runes winds from the bottom all the way to the top, pronouncing a curse on anyone who would disturb the peace of Aznadrad, the Witch King. The runes of the curse are magical and have the effect of trapping the spirit of any creature who dies on the staircase. Four adventurers have paid the penalty for their impertinence and lurk on the stairs as trap haunts to this day.

The entire length of the staircase is in the area of effect of the black noise, although only the first 10 squares vertically is in the area of effect of the life eater mist as well. However, the 11th square of the staircase is the trigger for a giant rolling boulder trap:

Giant Rolling Boulder (Level 14 Minion Blaster)  

Trap XP 250  

When this trap is triggered, a huge rolling boulder is released from a niche near the top of the staircase. It begins rolling down the stairs, crushing everything in its path.

Trap: A trigger you define releases a distant boulder that begins rolling toward the trigger area, and it rolls until stopped.  

Perception  
- DC 13: A character near the niche can determine that it holds a boulder poised to begin rolling when a chock is pulled.  
- DC 28: A character realizes that the trigger is in tension and that setting it off releases something.  

Initiative +2

Trigger  
The trigger is placed on a step on the 11th square of the staircase. When the trap is triggered, roll initiative. On its initiative count, the boulder moves.

Attack  
Standard Action Area trample attack in squares entered by the boulder or Immediate Interrupt
Trample: Each turn, the boulder moves its speed and enters creatures' spaces. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The boulder can end its move in an occupied space. Creatures in the boulder's space at the start of their turns have cover and can act normally. When the boulder enters a creature's space, the boulder makes a trample attack. If a creature enters a square of the boulder's space, the boulder makes a trample attack as a free action.
Trample Attack: +17 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 3d10 + 6 damage, and the target is knocked prone.  
Miss: Half damage.  

Countermeasures  
- A character adjacent to the rolling boulder can stop it with a DC 28 Athletics check. Making this attempt provokes a trample attack as an immediate interrupt, and the character's Athletics check fails if the boulder's trample attack hits.  
- A character adjacent to the trigger (or the location from where the trigger is activated) can delay the trigger with a DC 23 Thievery check.  
- A character adjacent to the boulder before it begins to roll can disable the trap with a DC 23 Thievery check. The character must have broken through the false wall first (AC 4, Fortitude' 2, Reflex 4; hp 30).  

The trap haunts lurk in fissures in the cliff face -- two near the trigger step and two at the base of the stairs. If the adventurers trigger the rolling boulder trap, the trap haunts will immediately apparate at the front and back of the party so as to block the intruders from moving out of the way. The trap haunts need not fear the boulder because they are insubstantial. Once it passes, they will take turns phasing in to attack in order to keep the party bottled up so that the black noise and life eater mist have longer to work.

### Pool and Waterfall

The pool is really an outlet at the top of a deep subterranean chamber filled by a spring of dark water that eventually flows to a tributary of the river Nythys, the fabled river of Thanos down which the souls of the dead must travel on their way to the beyond. Of course, the water is unhealthy for living creatures of the mortal world. A creature that enters or starts its turn in a square of dark water takes 5 necrotic damage and must save or be immobilized (save ends). Immobilized creatures are pushed 3 squares in the direction of the waterfall each round on the creature's turn. A creature swept over the edge of the waterfall takes normal fall damage (15d10), plus an additional 3d10 + 6 from the impaling crystal spikes in the basin.

In addition, the subterranean chamber is the lair of a shadow kraken. The creature lurks beneath the surface, where it is hidden until it attacks, which it will do 1-4 rounds after the water is disturbed.

### Collonade

The courtyard is flagged with oddly-shaped tiles of varying shades of grey arranged in a maddeningly complex pattern. The colonnade is formed by seven black marble obelisks is 15 feet high. Each has seven sides flat sides tapering to a cruel point at the top. Six of the obelisks are carved with Azruun runes extolling one of the triumphs of Aznadrad. The seventh, which stands directly in front of the entrance doors, has Azruun runes carved on it as well, but these are imbued with arcane power and the text seems to shift whenever the observer glances elsewhere:

Obelisk of Curses (Level 15 Elite Lurker)  

Trap XP 2,400

The faces of the obelisk ahead are covered with cruel runes that seem to shift when you glance elsewhere. The obelisk radiates a disturbing feeling of malice and you cannot read the script, but your eyes are drawn to trace over the runes nevertheless.

Trap: Taking the form of a stone obelisk extolling the virtues of some paragon of evil, this trap inflicts a random curse on one intruder each round.

The trigger area extends 10 squares around the obelisk. It draws its energy from living creatures not native to Thanos, and functions only as long as such creatures are within the area.

Perception  
No check is required to see the obelisk.

Additional Skill: Religion  
DC 27: The character recognizes the nature of the obelisk.

Initiative +6

Trigger  
When characters enter the area, the trap activates and rolls initiative. The trap continues its attacks until no living creatures remain in the area.

Attack  
Standard Action Ranged 10  
Target: 1 or 2 random living creatures not native to Thanos  
Attack: +19 vs. Will  
Hit: Target is affected by a random curse from the following table. Saving throws against these effects are made at a -5 penalty as long as the target is on Thanos:   

| d20 Roll | Effect |
| -------- | ------ |
|      1-3 | Target is stunned (save ends) |
|      4-6 | Target is blinded (save ends) |
|      7-9 | Target slides 3 squares in a random direction at the beginning of each of its turns (save ends) |
|    10-12 | Target gains vulnerable 5 to a random damage type for 24 hours |
|    13-15 | Target is slowed (save ends) in this and the next 2 encounters |
|    16-18 | Target is weakened (save ends) in this and the next 2 encounters |
|    19-20 | Target is surprised at the start of the next 3 encounters |

Countermeasure  
- A character can attack the obelisk (AC 26, other defenses 24; hp 200; resist 20 all). Destroying the obelisk disables the trap.  
- Blinded creatures are immune to the effects of the obelisk  

### Entrance

A portico with seven-sided columns of black marble extends into the front of the tomb from the plaza. At the rear of the portico, a staircase of black basalt mounts to the second tier of the mound. At the top of the staircase, a double gate of black wrought iron wards the entrance to the barrow. The bars of the gate are spiked, twisted and intertwined in such a way as to suggest a briar thicket.

Flanking the portico are two black marble daises, on which crouch large creatures that resemble a panther, black as night, with bat wings. These are sphinxes, charged to ward entry to the tomb by posing the following puzzle to any creature who would seek to enter:

Sphinx A: One of us always lies and the other always tells the truth.  
Sphinx B: One of the gates grants entrance to the tomb, the other is death to he who opens it.  
Sphinx A: You may ask either of us one question and he will answer. After this, you may attempt the gate once.  
Sphinx B: If you abide by these rules, we will allow you to pass, but violate them and you will know our wrath.  

This may seem to be a version of Knights and Knaves, which could be solved by the question "If I asked what gate leads to the tomb, what door would the other sphinx point to?” In fact, it is actually simpler than that. Both sphinxes always lie. Sphinx A is lying when he says otherwise. Both gates are deadly (in fact, they are a single construct). The sphinxes are bound only to guard the entrance and could answer any number of questions or none at all if they chose. They will attack living creatures just as soon as they have any excuse or get bored of the game. The sphinxes will also attack if the adventurers attempt to circumvent their guardianship. However, the sphinxes will watch passively if the adventurers provoke an attack by the shadow kraken as long as the combat does not encroach on the entrance.

2 Sphinxes (Level 16 Elite Soldier)

The gates are actually a construct that mimics the capabilities of a battlebriar:

Iron Briargate (Level 14 Elite Controller)

Despite what the sphinxes say, the iron briargates will allow only creatures designated by Aznadrad to pass. The adventurers are definitely not on the invitation list.

### Atrium

Aznadrad’s barrow is unique not only in having an open atrium, but in having that atrium exist in the mortal world. This is not to allow the lich to get fresh air (he doesn’t need it). Rather, it is designed to allow the Witch King to perform summoning rituals targeted to creatures native to the Far Realm that can be called down from the spaces between the stars. To this end, a large summoning circle is incised in the smooth, black stone of the floor in lines of chalk compounded from rare elements. Astute observers might note the following:

Perception DC 13 - The chalk is smudged in several places as if the lines and symbols had been erased and redrawn. (The Far Realm and the creatures that inhabit it are beyond comprehension in many ways, so Aznadrad has been obliged to experiment).  
Perception DC 15 - The air in the atrium seems fresh and wholesome and the sky is bright with stars. This is quite unlike the perpetual atmosphere of gloom that pervades Thanos.  
Arcana DC 17 - The symbols and lines on the magic circle are unlike anything used in conventional modes of summoning and conjuration.  
Arcana DC 17 - The constellations in the sky above are mostly those of the mortal world, but they are curiously misplaced and are joined by other unfamiliar constellations.  
Religion DC 23 - Some of the clusters symbols are apparently formulations of the names of powerful beings or places beyond the mortal world that are unknown in the conventional pantheon or cosmology.  
Arcana DC 27 - The confluence of lines and symbols indicate that the magic circle is concerned with forces from the dark spaces between the stars.  

The planar enchantment on the atrium allows it to open to the night sky of the mortal world in a location that can be controlled by a magician of sufficient power who possesses a bronze token, which Aznadrad wears on a chain at his belt, and a ritual, which Aznadrad knows but has not written down. This is why the open atrium is not accessible or even visible from the exterior of the tomb on Thanos.

If the adventurers disturb the magic circle, they will inadvertently open the way for a flock of cloaker ambushers that have been lurking around the extrusion of the Far Realm into the mortal world created by Aznadrad’s experiments so far. In ones and twos, the cloakers will drop down from the dark sky to envelop the member of the party who seems most vulnerable at the time.

3 Cloaker Ambushers (Level 12 Lurker)

The cloakers are aberrant monstrosities native to the Far Realm. Greedy to feast on the life force of mortal creatures, they can easily make the tactical mistake of attempting to feed while their targets have capable allies nearby. A cloaker will return from whence it came on its first turn after being bloodied, but if it has enveloped a creature at the time, the creature must save or be drawn partially into the Far Realm along with the cloaker. Creatures partially drawn into the Far Realm are Removed from Play for 1d3 rounds and return by being dropped from the sky. The returning creature takes 1d6 x 10 damage and falls prone on a random square in the atrium. Exposure to the Far Realm is so traumatic to the creature’s sanity that it is stunned when it first returns (save ends) and dazed thereafter (save ends). The creature will be unable to remember exactly what it was he or she experienced, but will have the general impression of a milky veil though which amorphous shapes of incomprehensively massive creatures could be vaguely glimpsed as an unearthly sound with a peculiar taste assailed the creatures senses.
