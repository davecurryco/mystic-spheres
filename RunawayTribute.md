# The Runaway Tribute

The party arrives at the town of Machu Quong on the south bank of the Chulang River to find it decked for a wedding festival.

For many decades, the town has paid an annual tribute of a girl of 14 or 15 years, given with all due ceremony as a bride to Jaman Khal, a mage of considerable power and resources. No one knows what happens to these unfortunate young women after they are carried aboard the wizard's red barge.

But this year, the chosen bride, a willful girl named Mulao, has disappeared. With only seven days remaining before Jaman Khal's visit and with no suitable replacement at hand, the town elders are frantic.

Mulao and her lover Kwan Liu, an 18-year-old deserter from the army, have found refuge in _Mute Canyon_. The girl's older sister Jinseo knows where they have fled and plans to bring them supplies in secret.

Jaman Khal is an archmage, the latest in a line of wizards who have passed that identity down from master to apprentice. The current Jaman Khal lives in a lavish yurt on wheels in the Golden Hills most of the year, but spends his summers afloat on a fantastic yacht cruising the Sea of Hormez. On his voyages he has traffic with denizens of the oceans and the trade has made him wealthy.

From the first, the Jamans have been advisors and supporters of the ruling family of the city of Baimin. This is why the town's appeals to their rulers went unanswered. In more recent times, the town's leaders have been corrupt merchants who have found ways to profit personally from the situation. 

On his trip back upriver each year, each Jaman has taken his tribute from Machu Quong. After enjoying his new bride for a season, he casts a spell of forgetfuless on her and sells her to a factor, who resells her to one of the bordellos in Khanengul. None of these women have ever returned to her hometown, and what they know would be a life of shame, to bear her tale. Some townsfolk say that the mage's bridges live in perpetual youth and beauty as a member of Jaman's harem in a luxurious mansion on a fantastic island. Others say that Jaman bathes in the young women's life-blood to maintain his life beyond his allotted span. Whatever the truth, the townspeople offer up their due each year submissively, cowed by dark hints of a disaster that ensued from an attempt to withold the mage's tribute generations ago.

# Encounters

## Machu Quong

### People

**Elder:** Jurdu Quo (noble) (Greed, Experimentation, Average)

Unremarkable in appearance. He wears an antique cloisonne medallion with a bird motif that came from the tomb of Lady Quinlau. He was a ne'er-do-well until a decade ago, when he inexplicably came by enough cash to buy a share in a merchant caravan organized by Chujao Lim. As it was actually a front for laundering stolen goods, the venture was immensely profitable and Quo became wealthy.

**Elder:** Chujao Lim (noble) (Power, Malicious, Tall)

Tall, muscular, and glowering. Lim is in his early forties. He ruthlessly manipulated his way to his present position, in large part so that he could destroy a merchant family that bankrupted his father. He has a longstanding secret business relationship with the lamia Xenadria.  

**Elder:** Tanlaw Mudhao (noble) (Glory, Confused, Exhausted)

Fat and sweaty -- in the sweltering humidity, the least exertion exhausts him. Mudhao enjoys the prestige of his title as Elder, which he attained on the merits of his father and grandfather, who preceded him in the position. Sadly, he is perpetually addled by wine. When Elders Jurdu and Chujao seized power in Machu Quong, they allowed Mudhao to stay on because he gave the Council the legitimacy of lineage and was easily manipulated. 

**Magistrate:** Urdhan Hondu (noble) (Money, Sad, Wrinkled)

Ancient. Magistrate Urdhan is the archetype of a corrupt judge. He is intelligent and cunning, but employs his talents to enrich himself. As he draws close to the end of his career, he is saddened by how far he has fallen short of the ambitions and potential of his youth.

**Priest:** Yehdran Gulao (priest) (Greed, Haughty, Hunched)

Old and bent. Master Yehdran 

**Tribute:** Jian Mulao (commoner) (Romance, Headstrong, Young)

**Lover:** Kwan Liu (scout) (Romance, Informed, Clumsy)

**Sister:** Jian Jinseo (commoner) (Experimentation, Critical, Dainty)

## Mute Canyon

_Map: Dodecahedron2015 - Valley of the Mounds_

A stream-fed box canyon that has unusual acoustic properties that deaden sound. For centuries, Juchin tribes have used it variously as a ritual site, monastery, and cemetery.

### The East Caves

This natural cave complex on the east wall was formed by the river that originally carved the canyon. In ancient times, it was used for burials, but although crypts are carved into the walls of each of the chambers, they are all empty. More recently, an ascetic sect used the caves as a hermitage, but they too have long abandoned the canyon.

Two **jackalweres** posing as hermits named Cho and Kwo have taken up residence in the cave complex. Their lamia mistress, Xenadria, has assigned them to spy on the town of Machu Quong. One of the first Jaman Khals imprisoned Xenadria in a vase and buried it in a crypt in what is now the ruins of an ancient town. Having cruelly slain the grave-robbers who found the tomb and inadvertently freed her, she sent her jackalwere servants far and wide to seek news of her ancient enemy. The tale of the annual tribute of Machu Quong reached her ears and she senses an opportunity for revenge.

When Mulao and Kwan Liu arrived at the canyon, the jackalweres assumed their disguise as hermits and befriended them in the hope that the young lovers might give them useful information. Their forbearance paid off when they learned the reason that Mulao fled Machu Quong. The "hermits" have offered to help the couple evade pursuit, but they are actually stalling until their mistress, who might be able to exploit the situation, uses her _scry_ spell to check on them. For this reason, the jackalweres will protect Mulao, although they would gladly be rid of Kwan Liu.

### The South Tomb Mound

Before the rise of the Azruun Empire, the Juchin nomads lived in a state of constant internicene warfare. One of the few warlords to achieve anything like unity among the tribes was Tamur Lohuan, who formed a short-lived alliance that sacked Masheer and Basrul and threatened Khanengul itself. The City of the Five Heights was saved when Tamur was assassinated and the alliance collapsed. Tamur was buried with all due honor, lest his spirit avenge any lack of respect, but his rivals carefully concealed the tomb and blotted out its location to prevent the rise of a successor from his clan. Subsequent erosion revealed the door of the tomb, but the reputation of the canyon as a holy site and the still-intact curses laid on the portal has so far prevented it from being violated.

### The West Tomb

The pillars and lintel of this tomb are of alabaster, once fine and polished, but now weathered and cracked. The door of the largest chamber, which was of bronze, is missing. The hall and chambers are empty except for dirt and debris, although in places the faint remains of elaborate murals can be discerned. The stone door to the burial chamber, which has fallen inward, bears the marks of forced entry. A stone sarcophagus, carved with a bird motif, lies in the center of the chamber. Its lid, marred and cracked, lies nearby amid rubble. Inside the sarcophagus are ancient bones.

The chamber is the haunt of Lady Quinlau, a **ghost** who appears as a plump, middle-aged woman wearing an elaborate ethnic dress of antique pattern. Her tomb was plundered several decades ago by a young Jurdu Quo, who used the proceeds to establish his fortune. Her spirit cannot rest until this crime is avenged.

Intruders in the tomb might suddenly feel hot or suffer from chills, as from a fever. They might catch side-glimpses of murals restored to their original vibrancy, only to see the colors faded away when they look at the wall directly.

## The Caravan

Xenadria travels in a large palanquin carried by eight human **commoner** slaves, with eight more as alternates. She is escorted by a troop of ten **guards** accompanied by six **jackalweres**, who disguise themselves as acolytes. A pack of eighteen **jackals** slinks nearby -- always just out of sight.

Behind the sliding screens of her palanquin, Xenadria lounges on silken cushions, but she uses _disguise self_ to appear as a priestess dressed in lavish ceremonial garb when she must show herself. The members of her retinue refer to her as Guaojaelin, "The Golden Presence".

Informed of Mulao's situation, Xenadria plans to use the girl as an instrument of her revenge. She will call Mulao into her palanquin and use _geas_ to charge the girl to assassinate Jaman Khal on their wedding night. Xenadria will give Mulao a vial of contact poison disguised as perfume, an antidote in the form of a small cake, and a lump of sugar consecrated to the goddess Shrivra, _goor_. The lamia will instruct Mulao to eat the sugar and the cake and then anoint her bosom with the perfume just before her husband goes in to her.

## The Barge

Jaman Khal's barge is a flatboat 35 feet long and 15 feet wide in the beam. It has a high prow and stern. The aft section is occupied by a cabin about 15 feet long with doors forward and aft. To the aft of the cabin is a platform for the **ogre** pole-man. The forward half of the barge is essentially a walkway for another **ogre** pole-man.

The cabin is the locus of a permanent variant of Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion. Inside the beaded curtains is an enclosed garden on a hillside into which a small mansion is built (Summoner's Lair - Dodecahedron 2015). There are guards and traps, of course, most of them supernatural.

## Caverns of Machu Quong

The limestone bluff on which the mansions of the leading citizens of Machu Quong are built is riddled with caverns. In recent times, these have been used by Chujao Lim and his gang to store stolen goods. In ancient times, the caverns were inhabited by lizardfolk. The remains of the fane of worship of one of their dark dragon gods remains.
