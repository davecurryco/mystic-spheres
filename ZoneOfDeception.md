# Zone of Deception

_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

You create a magical zone that enhances deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice in range. Until the spell ends, any creature in the spell's radius is immediately aware of attempts to use the _detect thoughts_ spell or other magical means to probe its mind. On its turn, a creature that has cast such a spell targeting a creature in the zone must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature protected by the zone can choose what, if anything, the creature casting the spell divines from it. On a successful save, the thought-reading spell ends without revealing any information.
