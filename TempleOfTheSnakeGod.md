_Map:_ [Temple of the Snake God Map](LahoorSnakeTempleMap.pdf)

Amid a labrynth of tangled growth, twisting creeks, and treacherous bog are the ruins of an ancient temple to Zaghir. 

## Encounter Areas

### A) Guard House

### B) Ruined Bridge

### C) Boat House

A collonade of caryatid (woman with snake hair) columns leads to the relatively-intact boathouse.

The **silver bard** will first appear here.

### D) Collapsed Chapel

Two animated caraytid (woman with snake hair) columns with the same stats as **gargoyles** but without the ability to fly are the center columns of the collonade. Each of the other caraytid columns has an illusion cast over it to make it move as though attacking when the gargoyles attack.

The altar and font have snake-motif carvings. The font still trickles water from a spring.

### E) Swamped Kitchen

A **swarm of poisonous snakes** lurks here and will attack intruders.

### F) Collapsed Bell Tower

Large cylindrical bronze bells decorated with a snake motif lay on their sides amid the rubble.

### G) Arborium

Sixteen statues of humans are arranged inside this building.

### H) Flooded Temple Buildings

### I) 

### J) Mansion

The **medusa** stalks here.

### K) Trapped House

There is a concealed pit-trap in this ruined priest's house.

### L) 

An intelligence **constrictor snake** lies draped along a branch of a tree above the roof of this building. It has the intelligence and _telepathy_ abilities of a pseudodragon and the _hypnotic gaze_ attach of an ultraloth (DC 14).

### M) Temple

A **bone naga** guards the altar, atop which is a golden idol of a hooded cobra with emerald eyes (2,500 GP). The altar is trapped with poisoned darts triggered by removal of the idol.

### N) Flooded House

A **water wierd** lurks in the waters of this house.

### O) Priest's House
