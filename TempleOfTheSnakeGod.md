# The Temple of the Snake God

## Introduction

Amid a labrynth of tangled growth, twisting creeks, and treacherous bogs are the ruins of an ancient temple to Zaghir. This is the lair of Veyanta, a **medusa priestess**. She dwells here with two constructs who can bear her petrifying gaze. Her companion, Ardomel, is a **silver bard** -- a perfect courtier made of metal and gemstones. In her solitude, Venyanta has come to love Andromel and he seems to requite her love, although this is only to be expected of a construct created to flatter and please its master. The temple guardian is a **bone naga** named Ssareth who is charged to protect a sacred treasure.

Venyata's curse was brought about by her narcissism, but she continues to perform the rites to Zaghir centuries after the city was deserted. Ssareth faithfully carried out his charge for centuries before this. Andromel is, of course, completely devoted to his mistress. 

## General Features

_Map:_ [Temple of the Snake God Map](LahoorSnakeTempleMap.pdf)

The jungle within 1 mile of the temple abounds with snakes of all sizes, many of which are poisonous. This accounts for a noticeable absence of birds and monkeys, which are plentiful in other parts of the city.

For each 10 minutes spent in the vicinity of the temple, the party has a chance of a random encounter:

| d20 Roll | Encounter |
| -------- | --------- |
|      1-2 | Harmless snake |
|        3 | Poisonous snake / Swarm of poisonous snakes |
|        4 | Constrictor snake |
|     5-20 | No encounter |

If the party encounters a snake within 1 mile of the temple, the medusa priestess will be instantly aware of their presence due to the regional effects of her lair.

The **medusa priestess** and **silver bard** start the adventure in randomly-determined locations:

| d6 Roll | Medusa Priestess Location |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
|       1 | D) Collapsed Chapel       |
|     2-3 | J) Rectory                |
|       4 | L) Kitchen                |
|       5 | M) Temple                 |
|       6 | P) Ceremonial Chamber     |

| d6 Roll | Silver Bard Location      |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
|       1 | C) Boat House             |
|     2-3 | J) Rectory                |
|       4 | O) Priest's House         |
|       5 | Q) Workshop               |
|       6 | With Medusa Priestess     |

Venyata, Andromel, and Ssareth are highly intelligent and will choose tactics appropriate to the situation as they perceive it. If the medusa priestess is aware of the presence of intruders, she will summon the silver bard to her side. Otherwise, if the adventurers encounter the silver bard alone, he will attempt to gauge their strength before he joins his mistress. He knows that she takes pleasure in destroying interlopers, but he must balance this against his duty to protect her. All three denizens will join together to defend against an attempt to rob the temple -- or track down and punish successful robbers.

## Encounter Areas

### A) Guard House

This abandoned house is trapped with a deadfall trap (DC 12) above the door, triggered by a crude pressure-plate. If the trap is triggered, a **poisonous snake** that had been sunning itself on the roof will also fall down on the target and attack.

### B) Ruined Bridge

The fallen stones of the bridge still display decorations in a serpent motif. The water on each side is 4 feet deep. It is possible to cross the creek and stay relatively dry by walking atop the stones. The crossing counts as difficult terrain for this purpose. However, many of the stones are illusory so each 5' of actual movement requires a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) saving throw to find a secure foothold. On a failed save, the target must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling into the water.

If the medusa is in the Collapsed Chapel when the adventure begins, she might choose to contest the passage of the creek at this spot, using the nearby columns to escape if the battle goes against her.   

### C) Boat House

A colonnade of caryatid columns leads to the relatively-intact boathouse. The women depicted in the caryatids have snakes for hair. An illusion causes them to move subtly, particularly when the viewer is not looking at them directly.

The boat house is small and lacks a door, but it has an intact roof so it is dry inside.

### D) Collapsed Chapel

Like the colonnade near the boat house, the colonnade along the path by the chapel is comprised of carytid columns depicting snake-haired women. These too are covered by an illusion that makes them appear to move. However, the two caraytids in the center are actually constructs similar to flightless **gargoyles**.

Inside the chapel, the altar and font have snake-motif carvings. The font still trickles with water fed through lead pipes from a spring.

The temple is the lair of a **giant constrictor snake**, which usually rests coiled in the darkness of the southeast corner of the chapel.

### E) Swamped Storehouse

A **swarm of poisonous snakes** lurks here inside a cracked earthernware jar the size of a hogshead cask. They will slither out to attack anyone who attempts to cross the creek by the stepping-stones to the west, which counts as difficult terrain.

### F) Collapsed Bell Tower

Four large cylindrical bronze bells decorated with a snake motif lay on their sides amid the rubble. Each is three feet wide and seven feet high and weighs over a ton. All are heavily corroded from being left out in the elements.

A character who closely inspects this area and makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom(Perception) check will notice that there are many pieces of stone scattered amid the rubble that do not match the stone of the tower walls. A successful DC 14 Intelligence(Investigation) check will reveal that these are fragments of statues. 

### G) Arborium

Sixteen petrified humans are arranged inside this flooded building. Most are Indhrus -- warriors, priests or thieves who sought the idol long ago. There are, however, some representatives of other races. Several Quetalpa tribesmen, a wiry Alhrain rogue, an elderly Juchin wizard and his burly bodyguard, and a plump Khemez woman are frozen in various postures with expressions of horror on their faces.

Venyata is too canny to leave petrified victims littering the grounds to put intruders on their guard. She has Andromel break up mundane ones such as goblins and scatter the pieces in the rubble of the bell tower. However, she is sentimental about some of her victories and so stores them here out of sight of interlopers. 

### H) Flooded Temple Buildings

A few temple buildings lie partly submerged in the water of the creek. They contain nothing of value.

### I) Library

This building once housed the work of the temple scribes. The rotted remains of desks and a scroll cabinet are all that remains. The scroll cabinet contains many scrolls that have completely deteriorated except for their rollers and handles. However, a few sacred texts remain:

_Tomes:_ The Luminous Libram of Alil: _This set of scrolls is contained in an electrum coffer. This spellbook contains the spells Control Weather, Mind Blank, and Power Word Stun._ The Principles of Vadhyana: _This eldritch compendium is wound in elm rollers inlaid with bronze. An individual who reads this scroll, which requires 48 hours over a minimum of 6 days, gains a +1 bonus to Constitution._ The Kamul Tablets: _This obscure collection of clay tablets is protected by a case of monstrous hide trimmed with bone. It is locked by magic, and can be opened only by a maiden. This spellbook contains the spells Fire Shield, Greater Invisibility, and Polymorph. It also contains much lore concerning the early Indhrus civilization._

### J) Rectory

The medusa priestess dwells in the rooms of this long-abandoned and half-flooded mansion, which was once her rectory.

The windows have no frames or shutters, but are hung with threadbare curtains within. Inside  

#### J-1) Spinning Room

The north room contains a spinning wheel and loom. Both are sturdy but well-worn and are set up with work, indicating current use.

There is also table near the window. Atop the table is a bronze coffer containing the medusa's treasure. The coffer is trapped with a poison-needle trap (DC 14 to detect, DC 14 to disarm, triggered by attempt to open the coffer, 1 hp piercing damage + 4d10 poison damage)

_Treasure:_ 600 cp, 1000 sp, 180 gp, 70 pp, Jeweled headdress (1,800 gp as an art object): Platinum (50 pp) + Carnelian (50 gp) + Chalcedony (50 gp) + Chrysoprase (50 gp) + Citrine (50 gp) + Jasper (50 gp) + Moonstone (50 gp) + Sardonyx (50 gp) + Star rose quartz (50 gp), Jeweled necklace (500 gp as an art object): Gold (100 gp) + 3 x Zircon (50 gp), Bag of Holding (uncommon, dmg 153), Potion of Fire Breath (uncommon, dmg 187), Potion of Greater Healing (uncommon, dmg 187), Wand of Magic Detection (uncommon, dmg 211), Spell Scroll (Guardian of Faith) (rare, dmg 200), Spell Scroll (Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum) (rare, dmg 200), Spell Scroll (Antilife Shell) (rare, dmg 200), Scroll of Protection (elementals) (rare, dmg 199) 

#### J-2) Dining Room

The northern end of this room is above water. It contains a larder, a round table, and three chairs -- all of which are deteriorated with age but still serviceable.

#### J-3) Hallway and Atrium

The front door is weathered and worm-eaten, but it still opens and closes on its corroded bronze hinges. It is generally unlocked.

The hallway leads to an atrium which is open to the sky at the center. A round pool lined with mosaic tiles lies beneath the roof opening. The water of the pool is murky and water-lilies grow rank on its surface.

#### J-4) Bedroom

This room too is mostly dry. A bed with a moss-stuffed mattress and a much-decayed wooden dresser stand near the window. A ceramic urn filled with fresh water stands in the northern corner. On the dresser is an ivory coffer that contains long-empty alabaster ungent jars and crystal perfume vials along with a woman's essential toiletries -- a lacquered boxwood comb, a silver brush with an ivory-inlaid handle, and a pair of zircon-encrusted tweezers. However, the kit lacks the hand mirror that would be typical of such an assembly.

#### J-5) Study

This room is completely flooded. The remains of a large wooden desk stand in ankle-deep water near the door. The south wall has collapsed.

#### J-6) Parlor

This room is flooded in ankle-deep water. A **poisonous snake**, a particular pet of Venyata's, lurks in a corner. It will telepathically alert the medusa priestess to the presence of intruders in this room or any of the adjacent rooms.

#### J-7) Bath

The marble-tiled floor of this room is flooded calf-deep in water. A corroded bronze bathing tub stands half-submerged along the north wall.   

### K) Trapped House

There is a concealed pit-trap in this ruined priest's house.

### L) Kitchen

An intelligent **constrictor snake** lies draped along a branch of a tree above the roof of this building. It has the stats and _telepathy_ abilities of a pseudodragon and the _hypnotic gaze_ attack of an ultraloth (DC 14).

### M) Temple

A **bone naga** guards the altar, atop which is a golden idol of a hooded cobra with emerald eyes (2,500 GP). The altar is trapped with poisoned darts triggered by removal of the idol.

_Treasure:_ Gem-studded gold cobra idol (10,000 gp as an art object): Gold (2,500 gp) + 2 x Emerald eyes (500 gp) + Bloodstone (50 gp) + 2 x Chrysoprase (50 gp) + 3 x Citrine (50 gp) + 2 x Jasper (50 gp) + Moonstone (50 gp) + 2 x Sardonyx (50 gp) + Zircon (50 gp) + Amber (100 gp) + Amethyst (100 gp) + 4 x Coral (100 gp) + Garnet (100 gp) + 2 x Jade (100 gp) + 2 x Spinel (100 gp) + Tourmaline (100 gp)

### N) Flooded House

This house stands atop a spring that erupted after an earthquake and flooded the low-lying ground to become the source of the creek that divides the temple grounds.

A **water wierd** lurks in the waters of the house.

### O) Priest's House

The windows look out on the ford and column bridge, providing good cover for the medusa priestess to snipe at intruders with her bow.

### P) Ceremonial Chamber

Stone statues of snake gods stand along the north and east walls.

### Q) Workshop

### R) Trapped House

There is a deadfall trap in this ruined priest's house.

### S) Safe House

The medusa priestess and/or silver bard will flee here if the fight is going against them.
