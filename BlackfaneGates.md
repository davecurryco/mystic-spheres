#Blackfane Gates

### Encounter G1.1: The Hades Gate

_A square gate-tower twelve stories high looms ahead of you. An arched portal twenty feet wide and at least thirty feet high leads into the tower. The portal is warded by a massive, red-painted door bound with black iron. The gate and its portcullis of black wrought-iron are both wide open. Just inside the portal, on either side crouches a monstrous black dog the size of a draft horse. Each dog has three heads and around each of its three necks is a spiked iron collar. The dog's heads each watch a different direction and its eyes glow like red-hot coals._

The dogs are **cerberus hounds** that Tyriana has bound to her service. They have been instructed to deny entry to living creatures and to raise the alarm if any creature attempts to enter by force or stealth.The hounds will, however, allow a creature that presents the coins from the Coffer Chamber to pass, along with any other creatures that accompany it. If the hounds raise the alarm, five **vampire spawn warriors** and a **vampire spawn spell caster** will respond on the next turn. They will enter from the second floor by the staircase on the left wall and will immediately attack any living creatures in the chamber.

The chamber beyond the gate is large and barren. On the wall opposite of the gate, there is a large archway which leads to the Caverns of the Dead. Above the archway, an inscription in elven is carved:

_"They leave all behind them, who cross the dark waters. From the far shore, there can be no return."_

### Encounter G1.2: The Caverns of the Dead

Beyond the archway of the gate, there is a network of dark, dismal tunnels and caves that echo with sobs, moans, and muttering, punctuated by  occasional scream of anguish. These are crowded with the spirits of the dead - ghosts of men, women, and children from a wide variety of nations and periods. Mostly, the spirits are occupied with their own misery and ignore the adventurers. However, a few pose a challenge or threat of some sort:

A) An ancient, toothless beggar woman dressed in rags approaches the adventurers and begs alms. If someone offers her a coin or two, she will mutter her thanks and depart. Otherwise, she will follow the party from room to room, clamoring incessantly for a handout.

B) A dark-haired girl seven or eight years old dressed in a simple gown of richly patterned silk appears and proffers a cup in both hands. If no one takes it, she will fade away, but will reappear in 1d4 rounds and repeat the action. She will do this three times. If, on the last attempt, none of the party takes the cup, she will use dominate person against a randomly-selected character. If she succeeds, she will force the dominated person to play tea-party for 2d4 rounds before losing interest and vanishing.

C) A stout peasant foot-soldier in cloth armor of an unfamiliar pattern brandishes a halberd and charges the party. As he approaches, he trips on his own intestines, which spill from a rent in the armor covering his abdomen. He lands sprawled and his halberd skitters across the stone floor. He clambers to his knees, but his head rolls from his shoulders and he sinks back down to vanish in a spreading pool of blood, which remains for 1d4 rounds. The halberd too remains, but it will crumble to rust and worm-eaten splinters if removed from the cavern.

D) A fat, bearded merchant dressed in brightly-patterned robes wrings his bejeweled fingers and paces back and forth. When he sees the party, he rushes forward and anxiously queries in a foreign tongue, “How does my ship? Has she landed? Are my goods safe?” He will babble on incessantly in this vein until the party leaves the area.

E) Two olive-skinned harlots with wavy black hair and gold rings in their noses flaunt their wares and beckon. If the adventurers approach, the ghosts will use horrifying visage to depict their deaths impaled on stakes, their bodies bloated by the sun, their blackened flesh riddled with maggots, and their eyes plucked out by birds. They will remain in this form until the adventurers leave the area.

F) A deranged-looking man with unkempt hair and beard walks rapidly down a tunnel and passes through the middle of the party, raving incoherently the entire time. As he does so, his passage raises a storm of debris. Each creature within 10 feet of the ghost must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4 (2d4) bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a success. The ghost continues down the passage out of sight.

G) A plump young noblewoman in an elaborate dressing-gown, which is drenched in blood from the waist down, sits hunched on the floor, clutching her knees and sobbing piteously. At the party’s approach, she lifts her head and uses possession against a random character. If this success, the ghost will insist that the party help her locate her child, with whom she died in childbirth. Nasaren, for that is her name, will continue to possess the character until she is forced out or turned, or until she can be convinced that she and her child are both long dead.

H) The chamber is filled with the scent of apple blossoms. A fresh spring breeze wafts through the air along with a faint, yet haunting melody played on a wooden flute. These effects accompany the ghost of a portly, middle-aged poet dressed in rich robes, who reclines on a rock as though it were the softest of couches. With eyes half closed, he sloshes wine from a shallow bowl as he waves it in time to the music. If approached, he will rouse from his semi-drunken reverie to dreamily declaim:

> revenge and cool wine  
> are thirsts never satisfied  
> song slakes the parched soul  

After speaking his poem, the poet and his effects will fade to nothingness. In life, the poet drowned. The rock on which his shade reposed will be wet even after he vanishes.

I) A slender elven-maid dressed in the white gown and veil of morning walks with slow, measured tread down the hallway, as if she were in a funeral procession. If she comes within 20 feet of the party, she begins to keen. Her cry has the same effect as a banshee’s wail, but this is not intentional. Unless she is attacked, she will continue down the hallway and vanish into the wall at its end.

J) From the darkness ahead, the sound of metal ringing against stone reverberates down he corridor. When the party gets closer, they can see the shades of two dwarven miners. One holds a star-drill against the wall while the other strikes it with a spectral sledge-hammer. Their bodies are horribly mutilated from the cave-in that killed them. If anyone thinks to investigate the spot where the two are drilling, a few taps of a real hammer will expose a small vein of uncut topaz worth 300 GP.

K) A thin, balding scholar wearing a blue robe and a purple cloak uses chalk to write out an elaborate formula on the floor. After several minutes, he shakes his head sadly, mutters to himself, and then erases his work and starts over. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check will reveal that the formula has to do with the absorption of magical energies into crystalline structures. A second, successful DC 22 check will reveal that the scholar is apparently dissatisfied that his formula fails to account for the known properties of a crystal called necrotite, which can absorb and store necrotic energy. A third, successful DC 25 check will reveal the scholar’s mistake: he assumes that necrotic energy, like radiant energy, is stored in the lattice-like crystalline structure itself. The formula works out right if one assumes instead that necrotic energy is stored in the spaces between the structure. This implies that necrotite crystals must be very large to store useful amounts of necrotic energy. Characters who observe the scholar himself will note that his joints move unnaturally, as though his body had been broken on the rack.

### Encounter G1.3 The Ferry Cavern

_An archway leads to a vast natural cavern. A stone staircase carved in archaic elven motifs leads down to a dock on a dark underground lake. A pair of flickering torches at the end of the dock create a little pool of illumination, but beyond it the ceiling and walls of the cavern are swallowed up in utter darkness. A small boat is tied up at the dock. It has the graceful lines of an elven vessel, but its wood is charcoal-gray. A figure gowned and veiled in the same somber hue stands on the dock near the boat. The veil conceals the figure's face, but the pale, delicate hands that hold the long sweep and hooded lantern the figure carries are those of an elven woman. Wispy patches of mist float above the water, vague, ghastly shapes move just beneath its surface, and sobs and murmurs echo dimly in the darkness of the cavern._

The chamber is indeed a natural cavern, but it has been placed under an illusion that functions as does a Mirage Arcane except that the spell can alter the shape and dimensions of the terrain. In this case, the cavern has been made to seem much larger than it actually is. The still air swirls with illusory mists and the clear, shallow water of the cave pool seems dark, vast and deep. The actual darkness of the cavern is given extra power by the illusion and affects sources of light as does the Darkness spell, except for the torches on the dock and the lantern the boatman carries. Creatures with truesight will see through these illusions and will see the ghosts and the statues of over a dozen of the medusa's victims in the middle of the chamber when they are within range.

The boatman is a **medusa** and the chamber is the haunt of ten **ghosts** and two **banshees**. They are actually Tyrania’s door-wardens, but at the vampiress’s macabre whim, they act out a mummery of the last journey of the dead.

At your approach, the veiled woman raises her lantern and says in the tongue of the Illuvarin, _“None may pass here but those who would leave everything behind. If any of you so desires, I will ferry him across the Great River, for that is my charge. In fee, I ask only two coins. All else he must leave here, for my boat may carry one soul and naught else."_

If the adventurers demonstrate any intent to attack the medusa or to go forward without her, she will attempt to dissuade them:

_“Think not that you can win across the dark waters unaided. Save for my protection, the spirits of the Lost would drag you down to the depths. Come, no one is my enemy. I give my service freely to all who meet my terms."_

If the party does indeed attack, the medusa will immediately flee. The nature of the illusion will cause it to appear that she has stepped into deep water and been swallowed up. At this, the ghosts will emerge from the mists to the attack.

The medusa will accept any two coins of any vintage or denomination as her fee. If she is paid with the old coins from the Coffer Chamber, she will ferry the character who does so across without treachery, provided that the character leaves everything he or she wears or carries behind. If some foolhardy adventurer pays with any other coins and strips down to be ferried across, the ferryman will scull the craft beyond the sight of the party, but near the midpoint of the cavern, she will suddenly raise her veil to attack with her petrifying gaze. If this succeeds, she will return after 10 minutes and offer to ferry someone else. If it fails, she will flee as noted before and the ghosts will attack the lone character.

Most of the medusa’s prior victims were allowed past the cerberus hounds at the gate on Tyriana’s orders so as to give the medusa some sport. The victims include solitary non-player characters and even entire parties of adventurers.

If the characters advance to the opposite side of the chamber, they will see a landing similar to the first. From this landing, a raised stone path leads to an archway.

### Encounter G1.4: The Feast-Hall of the Dead

_The archway opens on a large, cheerless hall of chill, gray stone. The central fire pit is filled with dead ashes. The torches set in brackets around the columns emit only the palest and coldest of light and the high-arched ceiling is lost in the gloom above. There are many tables set between the columns where skeletal guests sit as if to a feast, but the board is bare. At the chief table on the far end of the hall, a tall figure, robed and hooded in black, sits with a ram’s horn cup its elbow and an empty trencher of silver in front of it. From beneath the hood, a death’s head grins and rests its bony chin on the skeletal hands folded in front of it. On either side of the figure’s ornate chair made of bones stand two more black-robed figures. You cannot see their faces, but they have large black-feathered wings like a raven’s, and they prop scythes with long blades of gray steel on their thin shoulders with bony hands. All that grim hall is still and silent. Nothing moves, yet a sense of a brooding menace hangs in the stale air._

If the adventurers enter the hall, the figure will lift its gaze -- two points of cold light glowing from empty sockets. Its lipless, tongueless mouth will speak in a voice hollow and chill:

_“Would you who are still living join our feast untimely? Time eternal is an empty banquet. Did you not know? As well come late as soon, for there is neither surfeit nor lack where there is neither beginning nor ending. Tongues that cannot taste have no need of meat. Lips that cannot drink have no need of wine. Warmth and chill are one to fleshless bone."_

If the adventurers stay, the figure will speak again:

_“I see that you persist. Indeed, there are many here that might welcome you. For it is to you that they owe their own places in this company!"_

At this point, the adventurers will notice that the skeletons surrounding them are taking on the spectral appearance of humanoids they have killed in battle — goblins, hobgoblins, orcs, dwarves, and men. If the adventurers do not leave the hall immediately, the figure will speak once more:

_“Those you have vanquished, you owe them a weregild do you not? Yet, you cannot fill cup or plate for them. Neither can you stoke the hearth to warm them. What cheer can you bring to these drear walls, save the cold satisfaction of revenge?"_

The chamber is one of Tyriana’s macabre fancies — essentially, an elaborate riddle-trap. It is stocked with 50 **skeletons**, 10 of which are enchanted with a triggered _phantasmal killer_ spell. The cloaked figure at the chief table is a **spell wight** and his two guards are **dark devas**. All have very specific instructions as to the part they are to play in the vampiress’ mummery.

If the characters stay in the room beyond the wight’s third utterance, the undead will attack. The enchanted skeletons will target the closest non-undead creature with their spells and the wight and dark devas will gang up on the character they perceive to be the greatest threat. However, if the adventurers pick up on the wight’s hints (and possibly on the words of the ghost poet) and offer a song or performance in payment of their “debt”, the undead will listen raptly and, at the end, the wight will reward the party by giving them his cup and trencher.

The trencher is a silver platter worth 200 GP decorated in elven style with runes of enchantment to prevent it from tarnishing. The ram’s horn is bound with silver, but is not a cup after all, but rather a shofar enchanted so that its call can be heard by all creatures within 1,000 feet, whether outdoors, indoors, underground, or even on the ethereal plane. This horn is the key to the Hell Gate.

There is a wooden trapdoor covered by a rusty iron grate in the floor between the fire pit and the chief table. The grate is padlocked (DC 12). The trapdoor opens on a flight of stairs that descends into the darkness farther than any source of light can reach. The stairs are actually a magic portal that leads to a flight of stairs that ends in a niche in the cliffs near the Hell Gate.

### Encounter G2.1: The Torment Gate

_A twelve-story high, square gate tower rises from amid a thick tangle of huge, sharp-thorned briars. The briars grow so high that you can barely see the arch of the tower's portal and they spread out for at least twenty yards in front and to the sides of it. As you approach, you notice that there are many gargoyles made of a shiny black stone set in niches beneath the tower's machicolations._

The tower is surrounded by **daggerthorn briar** 20 feet high. Directly in front of the tower’s gate, there are four **battle briars**, which will move aside for authorized guests, but will attack intruders. There are nine **obsidian gargoyles** among nine other statues of the non-animated variety. They will attack along with the battle briars.

_Beyond the portal is a dark chamber lit by flickering torches set in the walls and candelabra and braziers of rusty iron set here and there around the chamber. From a hole in the apex of the high ceiling, many chains dangle into a circular pit in the center of the flag-stone floor of the chamber. Six man-sized iron cages hang from chains in alcoves along the left and right walls. Other apparatus of torture, racks, iron-maidens, chairs, wheels, and the like, is scattered about the chamber. Six huge humanoids, apparently torturers, move among the cages and other instruments, tormenting the occupants, whose screams and pleas reverberate from the stone walls in a cacophony of pain. The torturers are themselves draped with chains, perhaps as a kind of armor, or perhaps because they are slaves. In any event, they seem to be under the direction of an overseer, a diabolically buxom, red-skinned young woman dressed in red scale armor and carrying a spear. She is menacingly beautiful -- irresistible were it not for the horns emerging from her wavy black hair, the leathery wings that sprout from her back, the cloven hooves in place of her feet, and the cruelly barbed tail that lashes petulantly from her curvaceous bottom._

The tormenters are six **chain devils**. Each tormenter has an **imp** as an assistant. Their overseer is a **cambion**, Glazdria, one of the many daughters of Azariel. Through her mentorship of Glazdria, Tyriana seeks to curry favor with the infernal prince. However, the infernal princess is more than a handful to manage so Tyriana commonly sends her down to the shop floor (so to speak) to provide an outlet for her capricious cruelty. Glazdria bullies and abuses the devils and urges them to acts of sadism more depraved than even their diabolic imaginations could invent. The devils thoroughly hate her, but they would much rather die the most horrible death possible in this foreign plane than risk the displeasure of her father on their home plane.

Glazdria is independent-minded and will not necessarily attack the adventurers simply because they are not on the guest list. However, she is much easier to anger than to deceive. The devils will obey her orders unquestioningly. The imps typically go about invisible to escape Glazdria’s attention. In the event of an attack, they will band together to assault a single foe, preferably a soft target at the rear.

On initiative count 20, each of the chain devils can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* An instrument of torture (an iron cage, iron maiden, rack, chair, or wheel) that the chain devil can see within 120 feet of it animates for one round and attacks the nearest enemy. The torture instrument is an object with AC 16, 25 hit points, and speed 20 feet. The animated torture instrument makes an attack: Bind. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 (2d6) piercing or bludgeoning damage according to the nature of the device. Note that the grapple can continue even after the instrument is no longer animated.
* A brazier, candelabra, or torch bursts into a ball of flame. Each creature in a 10 foot radius must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
* A dead creature that the chain devil can see within 30 feet of it lurches forth as a zombie under the command of the chain devil.

If Glazdrina is reduced to 1/2 hit points or less, she will resort to Fiendish Substitution, a boon her diabolic sire granted to her for just such emergencies. She will use the respite to cast invisibility on herself and will prepare one of her potions of healing to drink on her next turn.

If Glazdrina is defeated, she carries the following individual treasure:

* Gold and ruby necklace worth 300 GP
* 10 100 GP gems
* Spear of Vengance (like Sword of Vengance; Glazdrina's spear becomes cursed when she is defeated)
* Pearl of Power (Glazdrina does not benefit from this, but it is set in a necklace she fancied)
* Scroll of Protection (vs. Undead; a gift from her father as insurance against treachery)
* 2 Potions of Superior Healing (rare, 8d4 + 8)

The circular pit is a dry well 200 feet deep. The bottom is enchanted with permanent _silence_ and _darkness_ spells. Above this, a series of permanent _minor illusion_ spells will make odd noises at random intervals. The grate-cover is enchanted with an _animate object_ spell that will cause it to fly off the opening of the pit if it is replaced. These effects are intended to create the impression that the pit leads to one of the planes of Hell (or worse). Actually, it is the lair of a **black pudding**, which waits to consume anything that comes into contact with it. The chain-devils delight in dangling chained victims in the well to suffer torments of the imagination in the dark. They also use the well as a disposal for bodies and offal, which keeps the black pudding content enough that it stays put.

Beyond the pit, on the wall opposite the entrance archway is another, smaller archway that is warded by an openwork gate made of welded links of spiked chain. Above this archway is another inscription in the same elven script:

_"There is no escape from pain save through forgetfulness. Once experienced, pain wracks anew he who remembers it."_

### Encounter G2.2 The Hall of Pain

_Through the gate is a long, dank, high-ceilinged hallway that seems to have been burrowed from the rock. Its rough roof is supported by pillars and arches of iron.  The ironwork seems to be ancient since it is pitted with rust and streaked in calcite deposits in many places. At intervals, small cages of iron holding sulfurous lights are set into the ceiling. The harsh, yellow-green light from these lamps leaves deep shadows and casts a sickly pall on whatever it does illuminate. The wall at the end of the hallway is covered with huge gears, screws, and springs, like some gigantic clockwork mechanism. In the middle, there is an convex iron door bolted with thick bars that seem to be inserted or withdrawn from the frame by means of a large wheel set in the middle of the door. Beside the door, a wretched old woman leans on a staff atop which burns a sputtering, unwholesome flame. She stares into a large copper cauldron that bubbles and steams atop a bronze brazier._

The woman is a **night hag**, who is bound to serve as Tyriana's door-warden. She has taken the form of an old woman, and in this guise goes by the name Nanny Widdershins. She knows the names, nature, and business of all who come to this hall. When the adventurers approach, she will greet them in familiar tones:

_"Come closer dearies, so that Nanny's old eyes may behold you well. Ah! You look to be brave and hearty. Perhaps one of you can pass the test. For only one may pass the door to the chamber within, and only thus may he proceed to the Spire where dwells our Lady. But I see that most of you are of a gentle folk of farm and herd -- simple and plump in the way of those who dwell in peace. For that, I do pity he who makes the attempt, for the unearthly pain he must endure abides long after in memory. Thus, I will offer you aid. Drink this draught and you will forget that which you endure and it will pass and trouble you no more."_

As impressive as the wheel mechanism is, the door is really opened and closed by a spell. The passphrase for this spell is a non-repeating, seven-word segment of an epic-length string of nonsense words which must be recited as the wheel is truned. Only Nanny Widdershins knows the string and where she is in the sequence. For this reason, she is the only creature who can open and close this door.

The circular chamber beyond the door is made of overlapping plates of iron, between which are sandwiched thin sheets of lead and enchanted silver. This prevents attempts to access the chamber by means of scrying, teleportation, ethereal travel, or similar magic. Once the door is closed, the chamber revolves 180 degrees counterclockwise (thus the hag's moniker "Widdershins") and rises 15 feet over the course of a minute to join with a passage that may be accessed through a door that only opens once the rotation is complete. During this time, the environment of the chamber and special enchantments placed in it combine to produce an acute sense of claustrophobia in its occupant. A creature that starts its turn in the chamber must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d10 psychic damage. The damage increases by 1d10 for each failed save. A creature that has failed at least one saving throw in the chamber will continue to be affected by the stress. Each time such a creature takes a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 1d10 psychic damage and lose all benefits of the rest, as memories of the harrowing experience recur.

The potion that Nanny proffers will indeed ameliorate the effects of the chamber. A creature that drinks the potion will not take the additional damage for failed saving throws, nor will it suffer ongoing effects during long rests. However, the creature will also forget the events of the previous 24 hours, including any spells prepared and experience points gained during that time.

If the party attacks Nanny, she will plunge her staff into the cauldron, which will instantly create a _stinking cloud_ with a radius of 30 feet around it. This same action will also summon forth fiendish _spirit guardians_ to protect the hag. Nanny is unaffected by the cloud and she will use its protection to lash out with her _staff of sickness_. She will escape into the Ethereal Plane as soon as she takes any damage and will then stalk the creature who dealt the damage in order to inflict a nightmare haunting on it the next time it sleeps. Nanny carries her heartstone and soulbag, and only a little individual treasure. She is not native to this plane, but to Hades, where her actual lair is.

Nanny has the following individual treasure in a pouch she carries at her waist:

* 170 SP
* 70 GP
* A dried monkey’s paw that clutches a Stone of Good Luck

Once the circular chamber stops rotating, its portal will align with a door that opens directly on the next chamber. This door is opened by a latch on the inside, but it has no latch on the outside. Once opened, the door will spring shut automatically after three rounds and the chamber will descend.

### Encounter G2.3 The Cavern of Bitter Chill

As soon as you open the door, the chamber is filled with a dazzling light and you feel a frigid blast. The cavern beyond the door glitters with ice and is brightly lit with an ambient light. The rime-covered ceiling hangs with huge icicles and frozen pillars stand like the trunks of trees in a forest. The air of the cavern is bitter cold and you can feel the chill penetrate to your bones. A few yards from the door, the frost-covered floor ends at the shores of a frozen underground lake. The lake must have some geothermal source, for scattered patches of water emerge through the ice to bubble and steam like cauldrons. In the distance, islands of ice-covered rock loom over the surface of the lake, but the mists obscure your vision after a few score yards.

The unnatural chill of the air drains heat from anything around it. Creatures who start their turn in a square not adjacent to one of the active cauldrons must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 8 (2d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The mists lightly obscure vision beyond 60 feet and heavily obscure vision within 10 feet of an active cauldron.

The icy surface of the lake is difficult terrain. Especially near the cauldrons, there are patches of thin ice. Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 x 10 pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through.

In each round, roll a d20. On a 1, one of the cauldrons near an adventurer (roll randomly to determine which) will erupt as a geyser. Creatures within 10 feet of a geyser must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12 (3d8) heat damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the cauldron was an inactive one, it becomes active for 1d6 x 10 minutes.

Two **ice devils patrol** the cavern with their _ice devil spears_ and an **arctic worm** lurks nearby beneath the frozen surface of the lake. Another two ice devils keep watch from an rime-covered tower on a promontory of rock that rises from the ice on one wall of the cavern. These two man a ballista that hurls heavy glass balls filled with an enchanted liquid that bursts into intense flame when exposed to the air. The ballista shot has same effect as a regular ballista bolt followed by a fireball spell. The heat will create a patch of thin ice 10 feet in diameter centered on the point of impact on normal ice, or will melt a 10-foot diameter hole in thin ice.

The arctic wyrm will burst suddenly through the ice at a thin spot to ambush the adventurers. The ice devils will stalk the party at a distance until the wyrm attacks and will join the fray in 1d3 rounds. The ice devils and the arctic wyrm are unaffected by the difficult terrain of the lake, although the devils will avoid patches of thin ice, while wyrm will simply break through them unimpeded.

On initiative count 20, the arctic wyrm can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the wyrm can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its run in the fog takes 10 (3d6 cold damage). A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the wyrm uses this lair action again or until the wyrm dies.
* Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the wyrm can see within 120 feet of it. The wyrm makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
* The arctic wyrm lashes its tail against the frozen surface of a body of water in its lair. A 20-foot by 20-foot area within 15 feet of the wyrm becomes thin ice, if it was solidly frozen before, or becomes broken ice if it was already thin.

The artic wyrm keeps a hoard of treasure collected from its victims in a crevasse in the deepest part of the lake, 80 feet beneath the surface. The treasure lies scattered carelessly among the bones and gear of the wrym's victims:

* 300 CP; 600 SP; 1,700 GP; 160 PP
* 9 500 GP gems (3 alexandrite, 4 aquamarine, 2 Peridot)
* Potion of supreme healing
* Potion of invisibility
* Staff of the adder
* Horn of blasting
* +2 Whip

The frozen lake continues to the far end of the cavern, where it meets the wall. In a niche entombed by a wall of ice 10 feet thick is a double-door of bronze set within a stone archway. At need, the ice devils can summon the arctic wyrm to burrow through the ice wall, but the adventurers will need to find another way to access the door. On the arch is elven script reading:

_“On the path of the final journey, expect the worst and you may find it. That which is free to the fool may be dear indeed to the wise."_

### Encounter G2.4: The Coffer Chamber

_Beyond the bronze door is a domed chamber. In the center of the floor is a circular dais that supports a bronze canopy on four bronze columns. The columns and canopy are fashioned as stylized trees with their branches interlaced. In the center of the dais is an ornate bronze coffer. In a large alcove at the opposite side of the chamber is a bronze statue of a dragon that stands rampant with wings and fore claws spread and mouth gaped. On either side, a smaller alcove holds a dragon statue of the same material and workmanship. In these smaller statues, the dragon crouches, its fangs bared in a snarl._

This room and everything in it are components of a complex trap. This trap is intended to be lethal because Tyriana reasons that anyone who would attempt to plunder this room is probably up to no good. In fact, the interconnected traps are designed so that the more countermeasures are taken, the more lethal the chamber becomes.

#### Auto-closing Doors
_Magically Triggered Mechanical Trap_  
Just before the illusion covering the pit is dispelled, the double doors to the chamber will slam shut unless they are held open by a means sufficient to counter the door mechanism (a DC 25 Strength check).

#### Illusion-Hidden Pit
_Magically Triggered Mechanical Trap_  
The shaded section of the floor (everything but the dais, the alcoves, and the threshold of the double door) is a pit 60 feet deep which has been covered by a spell similar to mirage arcane so that it appears to be a solid, marble floor. As with mirage arcane, creatures can physically interact with the illusionary floor and cannot detect it as an illusion without the use of true sight or similar magic.

Creatures standing on the floor when it is dispelled will fall into a 60’ deep pit and take the normal falling damage. If a creature is standing on a square adjacent to one of the “safe” squares in front of the door or alcoves or adjacent to the dais, the character can make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling into the pit by jumping onto the adjacent square.

#### Floor Pressure Plates
_Mechanical Trap Trigger_  
The floor of the dais immediately surrounding the chest consists of four 5’x5' pressure plates. With a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals un-mortared crevices in the floor tiles that betray the pressure plates’ presence. Wedging an iron spike or other object in the crevices prevents the pressure plate from activating.

#### Cage Trap
_Mechanical Trap_  
The bronze canopy over the dais is actually a cage trap. When this trap is triggered, loud metallic click sounds will reverberate from within the bronze columns. Suddenly, the bronze canopy over the dais will rapidly descend down its columns, driven by worm-gears hidden in each of them. A creature standing in one of the squares of the dais must immediately choose to stay in place or jump off the dais. If a creature decides to jump, it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw if it is standing on a square on the edge of the dais, or a DC 15 saving throw if it is in one of the interior squares. On a successful saving throw, the creature jumps off the dais and onto the pit area. On a failed saving throw, the creature must make an additional DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If this second saving throw is successful, the creature will be trapped within the cage. A creature trapped within the cage has three-quarters cover against attacks originating outside it and complete cover from the effects of the collapsing ceiling. If the save fails, the creature is pinned by the canopy. A creature so pinned will be knocked prone, suffer 6d6 bludgeoning damage, and be restrained until it escapes. However, such creatures will have complete cover from the collapsing ceiling as well.

With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot that the canopy suspiciously resembles a cage. A search of the columns accompanied by a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check by a character standing on one of the interior squares of the dais reveals deep grooves on the inward side of each column. Once the grooves are detected, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check will reveal a row of deep iron ridges at the back of each groove. Following this, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check on the canopy will show that it is upheld by bronze tongues concealed in its corners that are inserted into the grooves in the columns. Wedging an iron spike or other object in the ridges will disarm the trap if the object is wedged in at floor level (otherwise, it just falls out when the worm-gear begins to rotate).

#### Coffer Pressure Stud
_Mechanical Trap Trigger_  
The coffer sits on a pressure stud. A character who attempts to lift the coffer carefully must make a DC 18 Dexterity check. A successful save allows the character to make a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check to detect the stud before it triggers. A successful DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the pressure stud, allowing the coffer to be removed. Failure on any of these saving throws triggers the trap mechanism.

#### Poison Needle
_Mechanical Trap_  
The coffer is trapped with a poison needle, which springs out 3 inches straight from the lock. A creature within range is pricked by the needle, but the poison has decayed (50% harmless, 50% inflicts 1 piercing damage).  A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to detect the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools picks the lock. An unsuccessful attempt to pick the lock triggers the trap unless it has been disarmed.

#### Gas Spewing Statues
_Mechanically Triggered Magical Trap_  
When triggered, the jaws of the crouching dragons will drop open and the statues will spew clouds of purplish gas into the room. This gas is heavier than air, so it immediately sinks into the pit and fills it to a height of 30 feet from its floor. The gas lingers and is potent for 1 minute. A creature that is in a square adjacent to one of the statues when the trap is triggered must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. On the next round and while the gas lingers, a creature that starts its turn in the bottom 30 feet of the pit must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. A creature so poisoned suffers amnesia for 1d20 rounds minus its Constitution bonus. Victims of this amnesia cannot act on knowledge learned in the past 8 hours. Wizards and members of other classes who must memorize spells will be unable to cast spells above 1st level for the duration of the effect.

With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot that the crouching dragon statues are suspiciously depicted drawing in their breath. A search of a statue accompanied by a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check by a character standing in an adjacent square reveals that the statue’s jaw is articulated. Binding the statue’s jaw or disassembling it prevents the trap from activating in this way. A successful dispel magic (DC 14) cast on a statue destroys the trap.

If a statue has been prevented from activating normally but has not been disenchanted, it will explode in a blast that fills a sphere 60 feet in diameter with bronze shrapnel two rounds after it is first triggered. Creatures in the area of effect must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d4 piercing damage and 4d10 force damage on a failed saving throw or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Roaring Statue
_Magical Trap_  
When this trap is triggered, the large dragon statue emits a blast of noise that reverberates throughout the chamber. Creatures within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on the statue’s mouth must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures within a 60-foot radius sphere centered on the statue’s mouth must also make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 10 minutes.

With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot that the rampant dragon statue is suspiciously depicted as though it were roaring. A search of the statue accompanied by a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check by a character standing in an adjacent square reveals that at the back of the dragon’s mouth is a round pipe that extends into the statue’s interior, as if it were the beast's throat. Choking the pipe with rags or other similar objects prevents the trap from activating in this way. A successful dispel magic (DC 14) cast on a statue destroys the trap.

If the statue been prevented from activating normally but has not been disenchanted, it will vibrate violently when the trap is triggered. Three rounds later, the ceiling of the chamber will collapse. The rain of rubble will collapse the ledge the statue stands on and topple the statue itself into the pit. A creature standing in one of the squares of the alcove or the ledge in front of it must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit. A creature unlucky enough to be beneath the statue when it falls must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Collapsing Ceiling
_Mechanical Trap_  
When this trap is triggered, the ceiling of the chamber collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the domed ceiling must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the are is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.

#### Trap Activation Sequence

The chamber is designed to have its minimum lethality if someone were to simply open the double doors to the chamber, walk up to the dais, remove the coffer, and walk out. If a weight of 60 pounds or more is placed on any of the pressure plates in the dais floor, followed by removal of the pressure on the pressure-stud under the coffer, followed by a removal of weight from the same pressure plate in the next round, none of the traps in the chamber will be triggered. The coffer-snatcher would only need to contend with the practically harmless poisoned needle trap and could leave the chamber by the same way he came in.

On the other hand, if the pressure plates have been disabled or circumvented, but the pressure-stud detects that the coffer has been removed or even made lighter by the weight of the coins in any turn, the complex trap is triggered as follows: Immediately, the illusionary floor is dispelled. In the following round, on initiative count 20, the canopy cage trap is triggered. On initiative count 18, the crouching dragon statue traps are triggered. On initiative count 10, the large rampant dragon statue trap is triggered.

#### Treasure

Once opened, the coffer will be found to contain only two non-magical copper coins covered in verdigris. The inscription on the coins is illegible, but the design on the obverse can be recognized as a boat with an oarsman manning a stern-sweep. The design on the reverse is worn and heavily obscured, but it seems to be a death’s head with thick, wavy hair. These coins can be presented to the cerberus hounds at the Hades Gates and to the medusa ferryman beyond it as a token of passage.

#### Ways Out

If the entrance doors were not prevented from closing, the doorway will become a one-way portal to the courtyard outside the Hades Gate.

The central pillar of the chamber is hollow. An iron door on at floor-level in the pit opens on its interior, through which winds a spiral staircase of iron. The staircase ascends to a small circular chamber that contains the mechanisms that allow the traps to be reset. It descends to the floor of a large, dark cavern, the ceiling of which is roost to innumerable bats. A winding stair climbs from the floor of the cavern over 200 feet up its wall to one of the innumerable cave-mouths that pockmark the cliffs of the outer Ring.

### Encounter G3.1: The Hell-Gate

A deep chasm opens before the portal of this square, twelve story-high gate-tower. An abutment built of great blocks of black stone stands opposite the portal on the side nearest you, but there is no bridge. The iron-bound, red door of the portal is closed and an iron portcullis with bars wrought in the shape of gnarled tress with interlaced branches and roots guards it. The walls of the chasm flicker red from a fire that burns unceasingly far below.

The chasm was formed by a planar rift to one of the infernal planes. It is 120 feet deep. The rift effect essentially creates a wall of fire 20 feet thick that stretches across the width of the chasm and extends from its bottom to 120 feet above ground level. Anything that crosses this wall on the material plane takes 6d8 fire damage. The wall acts as a forbiddance spell against attempts to cross from one side to the other by means of arcane gate, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, or similar magic.

The portcullis and doors are barred shut from the inside. Each of the gate-towers is pierced with five arrow-slits on each side, beginning 20 feet above the ground and staggered according to their position along the stairs that wind around the inside of the tower. From these slits, the 7 flamethorn devil guardians of each tower can cover the courtyard below with their fiery breath attacks. Two more of these devils stand watch behind the crenelations atop each of the towers at all times. While on duty, the watch-devils each wear an iron chain with a iron medallion fashioned in the shape of half a gate. When adjacent to each other, each of the wearers of these medallions can use the following spells once per day each as if they were 10th level spellcasters (spell save DC 16). If one of the wearers dies, the medallion it was wearing will disappear with it, rendering the other medallion useless.

#### Medallion of the Tower Guard
_Unique_  

* _alter self (change appearance plus or minus 1 size)_
* _banish_
* _bigby’s hand_
* _conjure volley_
* _dispel magic (up to 5th level)_
* _wall of force_

These formidable defenses can be bypassed. If someone winds the ram’s horn from the Feast-Hall of the Dead, a drawbridge will magically extend across the chasm, the portcullis will raise, the gates will swing open, and the guards will allow the party to pass.

Within the gate is a chamber dedicated to the worship of Tyriana's former patron:

_You are in a chamber of polished black stone. Fluted octagonal columns uphold elaborate, high-peaked arches, which support a ceiling that reaches twenty-five feet at its peak. The floor too, is of polished black stone, but veined with red and flecked with gold. High overhead, four massive chandeliers of black iron hang on heavy chains from the ceiling. In the wall opposite the one you entered, there is an archway that seems to open on a chamber of fire. On either side of the chamber are alcoves in which are set windows filled with an intricate mosaic of stained glass in hues of ruby red and wine purple. The light from the windows, the flames in the archway, and the candles in the chandeliers are reflected in the floor and on the walls. They give the whole chamber a ruddy glow and fill it with flickering shadows._

_At the center of the room stands a slab of black stone, on which two statuesque, feathery-winged women arrayed in gear of war kneel facing each other. The light of the flames in the archway reflects on their lacquered, black plate armor and the naked, black blades of their swords. Curls of red hair spill from beneath their horned black helms. Even in profile, you can see that the women have lovely faces with chillingly perfect features. They do not lift up their faces, but their challenge rings in your mind, "Who are you, mortals, and why come you unbidden here?"_

The two women are erinyes devils bound to Tyriana's service. She delights in humbling these proud, female fiends and so has assigned them duties as lowly gate-wardens. The erinyes will question any creatures that come into the chamber and will vent their spite on those that cannot give a satisfactory account of their business in the Spire. Lurking in the darkness are twenty shadows that will attack as allies of the erinyes.

The slab of black stone is an unholy altar. The erinyes can evoke its infernal power to cause it to fill the entire chamber with shadows that merge to become a magical darkness. Normal light and magical light created by spells of 5th level or lower can't illuminate the area. Holy water poured over the alter will end this effect for 24 hours. The erinyes and the shadows can see normally in the darkness shed by the altar, the former because of their truesight and the latter because they are native to shadow, from which the darkness originates. Creatures in the area have resistance to radiant damage caused by spells cast from slots of 5th level or lower or magic items of types less than very rare. Having done this, the erinyes will take flight and ply their bows. Their vindictive nature will lead them to target the weakest good-aligned foe in order to inflict casualties as quickly as possible.

If the adventurers gain to the other side of the chamber, they will see that the archway that leads out is quite remarkable:

A bas-relief carving of a horned, diabolical face is set into the wall. Its gaping mouth forms the archway you saw from across the room. Between its fangs, you can see little but tongues of flame. Wisps of smoke curl from the opening and the air before the portal shimmers from the heat within. With some difficulty, you can make out an inscription in elven script graven above the archway:

_"They are purified, who pass through the furnace. The dross burns away, and only that which is true remains."_

### Encounter G3.2: The Fiery Furnace

_Through the flickering flames, you glimpse an enormous cavern beyond the portal. Its ceiling drips with stalactites and stalagmites poke out among piles of hot coals on the floor. Deep pits and chasms in the floor occasionally erupt in furnace-like blasts of fiery gases. A path of compacted ash and volcanic rock winds among the obstacles, although it is obscured in places by loose rubble that has fallen from the ceiling._

_A little way inside the chamber, a tall, clean-limbed young man stands with his head bowed. Although there are heaps of burning coals beneath his bare feet and flame laps at the hem of his white robes, he takes no harm. As you stand outside the archway, driven back by the searing heat, the man looks up at you, or at least you think he does. His face is very handsome, but his eyes are lustrous silver orbs, lacking pupils and irises. He greets you in a mellifluous voice, saying, "He who comes to me will I lead through the flames of woe. He shall not perish so long as he follows in my steps, albeit he may suffer for the evil that is cleansed from him."_

The guide is a **deva**, a fallen angel banished from the celestial planes. His sense of destiny led him to seek out this place and take service with Tyriana, but he does not know how this will bring about the redemption he seeks. The deva reveals his name to no one and disguises his true nature by means of his change shape ability. Detection spells will reveal that the deva is telling the truth and is good-aligned. Tyriana is aware of all this, but it amuses her wickedness to put a powerful good-aligned being to such use. She hopes that the celestial's pride will someday complete his downfall.

This chamber is under an enchantment similar to mirage arcane that transforms its terrain to the hostile environment described. Creatures who end their turns in the chamber take 12 (2d8 + 4) fire damage. On the third round after entering the chamber and on each round thereafter, a creature wearing metal armor will take an extra 4 (1d8) fire damage. A creature that moves into or begins its turn on a square of the floor that is not on the path will take an additional 12 (2d8 + 4) fire damage and must make a DC 11 Dexterity save or have one worn or carried flammable item destroyed by the flames. Every 1d4 turns, a randomly-chosen chasm or pit will erupt and creatures within 5 feet of it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The stalagmites are blocking terrain and areas strewn with rubble are difficult terrain. A creature with truesight will still take the fire damage and be subject to the obstacles, but will see the chamber as it is, which will allow that creature to take less time to travel through it.

The deva may protect a single good-aligned creature within 5 feet of him from the ambient damage. An evil creature will take half damage until further damage would reduce it to 0 hit points. A neutral creature will take one-quarter damage until further damage would reduce it to 0 hit points. However, the deva must still take a meandering path through the illusory obstacles in the chamber floor and is under strict instructions to walk at his normal pace without stopping or taking other actions. This may well mean that a creature that attempts to follow the deva is not able to keep up, especially since the path is difficult terrain in many places.

Five **salamanders** lie concealed at the far end of the chamber and wait to ambush creatures who attempt to cross at that point. The deva knows this, but he is forbidden to communicate anything other than his prepared greeting.

If the adventurers search the cavern carefully, they will find the salamanders' individual treasure hidden in niches and beneath loose stones:

* 70 GP
* 230 SP and 100 GP
* 1000 CP and 40 EP
* 250 SP and 80 GP
* 220 SP and 50 GP

The path leads to a wide and deep crevasse that opens in the floor of the cavern and descends down a narrow ledge on its left side. The deva can go no further than this, for he is forbidden to leave the furnace chamber. Flames flicker in the darkness far below the path and, although the air is stifling, it is not hot enough to cause damage. However, the ledge is narrow and treacherous. A creature that moves at more than half speed across the ledge must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw at the end of each movement or Dash action or fall prone. A creature that falls prone on the ledge must make a second DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the edge to the depths of the crevasse 1,200 feet below. The bottom of the crevasse is filled with lava. Any creature that enters or starts its turn within 60 feet of the bottom will take 8d6 fire damage.

The crevasse is the abode of 26 **fire bats**. On the third round after the first creature enters the chamber, the fire bats will rise in a swirling cloud from the depths of the crevasse and attack. On each round, 1d3 bats will make a swooping attack against each living creature in the chamber. They will ignore undead and constructs. Their rapid, erratic flight makes it impossible to track any individual bat, so any attacks against them will target the bats at random. The bats will attack until all are slain or no living creatures remain in the crevasse chamber.

### Encounter G3.3: The Tunnel of Horrors

_The path leads on along the ledge for several hundred yards and descends over 200 feet before it ends at the sheer face of the crevasse. At the back of a narrow landing, the rock is carved to resemble a monstrous face distorted in pain. The gaping mouth forms an archway, beyond which is a dark tunnel that seems to have been bored into the rock like a maggot-hole. As you approach the mouth of the tunnel, you hear a faint babbling murmur as of many voices from within. A stench like that of rotten meat issues from the darkness as well._

The tunnel is irregular, but is generally round, about 10 feet in diameter. It is not entirely straight either, but curves gently left and right and up and down. After the first sixty feet, the dark gray rock lightens and takes on a pinkish cast. The walls of the tunnel become slick and glisten with moisture. The murmur and the smell increase and the source of both become apparent:

Ahead, the walls of the tunnel become a horror of oozing flesh embedded with deformed faces and detached limbs and studded at random with glaring eyes and gaping, sharp-toothed mouths. As you approach, the faces and limbs writhe and the mouths babble, chatter, and wail incoherently.

The tunnel extends 200 feet beyond this point. Every third 5-foot section of the tunnel wall is treated as a **gibbering mouther**, except that it cannot move and does not have the blinding spittle attack. The _abberant ground_ and _gibbering_ effects apply along the entire length of the tunnel. Each "mouther" will make opportunity attacks on creatures that move out of adjacent spaces.

The tunnel opens directly on the face of the inner cliffs surrounding the spire. At its end, an abutment built into the cliff supports a ribbon of black stone, without rail or curb, that extends hundreds of feet through the swirling maelstrom, to an archway in the side of spire. In the last 100 feet of the tunnel, the howling winds of the maelstrom drown out the gibbering from the mothers. Beyond this, an archway opens on a landing, past which rises a steep stone staircase.

### Encounter G3.4: The Steep Stair

_The staircase ascends through a short tunnel that opens to a stone landing on the inner face of the wall of cliffs. As you climb the staircase, a sound as of a shrieking wind grows louder. It is the roar of the maelstrom that surrounds the spire. At the landing the sound is almost deafening. The landing is without guard or rail and on two sides, it looks out over a sheer drop into darkness. To the left, the stair cuts steeply up a crevice in the face of the weathered cliff. So steep is the stair that you can use your hands on the steps to help you climb. Indeed, hugging the steps offers protection from the winds of the maelstrom, which otherwise would sweep away anyone on the landing or stair._

You cannot see what is at the head of the stairs above you, but high above you can see an abutment for a black stone bridge that extends through the howling maelstrom across the gap between the inner cliff and the spire. It defies belief that the bridge spans such a distance without arches, supports, trusses, or even so much as a handrail, yet it does.

The steps are irregular and treacherous so they are considered difficult terrain. The stair climbs to a boulder-strewn ledge one-hundred and fifty feet above the level of the landing. Among the boulders are six **galeb duhr**, who are charged with the defense of the bridge. They have been instructed to allow no creature to pass who does not say the password "hithrion" (blood-red in elven). Unless an alarm has been raised (by the medusa, for example), the galeb dur will issue a challenge when their tremorsense detects any creature larger than a rat within 60 feet of the head of the stair:

About two-thirds up the stair, you hear a deep, rumbling voice that seems to come from the very rocks around you. Even above the maelstrom's howl, the challenge rings like a hammer on stone, "By what word come you here?" However, you cannot not see anyone who might have challenged you thus.

Unless someone in the party immediately says the password, the galeb dur will attack by animating boulders and causing them to roll down the stairs at intruders. Adventurers who attempt to fly above these attacks risk being swept away in the maelstrom.
