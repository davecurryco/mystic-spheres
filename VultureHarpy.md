**Vulture Harpies** are larger, more intelligent, and grimmer than regular harpies. Their skin and feathers are jet-black and their features are sharp and cruel. They lack the charm abilities of regular harpies, but are bolder and even more sadistic.  

**Ancient Race.** Unlike regular harpies, vulture harpies did not originate from a cursed progenitor. Rather, they are the remnants of an ancient race cast out from its original home and forced to seek refuge in this world. Their selfishness, cruelty, and decadence made them outcasts even in their new surroundings and thwarted all attempts to rebuild their civilization. Even at the remove of many centuries, vulture harpies still dwell in isolated colonies as squatters amid the ruins of other cultures or, more rarely, as servants of some powerful and wicked overlord.
