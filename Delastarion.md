# Delastarion

Delastarion was formerly a fortified frontier town of the Telenar Colonies that was recently overrun by goblins and related monsters. Under the leadership of an exceptionally large and intelligent ogre named Gorbast, the town has become a trading center where the goblin tribes, ogres, orcs, hobgoblins and other races set aside their differences for mutual profit. The goblins renamed the place Bar-Krorgroshir (Dwelling Between Waters) after their fashion.

## Layout

The city's walls are built on a foundation of enormous blocks of a strange greenish-gray stone, topped by more recent stonework of native gray granite. Hasty repair work and improvised fortifications have given way to more permanent construction designed by duregar engineers and built with goblin labor.

Inside the gates, most of the city is still a hodgepodge of buildings. Many are built wholly or partly with greenish stone salvaged from ancient structures. Some are intact from the days of the Telenar. Others have been rebuilt, but very few now are still in ruins. In the goblin slums, temporary shelters ranging from mud huts to hide tents clutter the alleys and squares, and the burgeoning population has encroached on the lanes and thoroughfares. Smoke rises from every chimney and roof-vent and from open cooking fires scattered among the tents. In increasing contrast, the districts occupied by the duergar contain mostly new buildings that line well laid-out streets.

The major streets are paved, but the older pavements are in poor condition. Many minor lanes and all alleyways in the goblin districts are unpaved and become ankle-deep muck during the early winter and spring and again during the summer rainy season. However, due to an ancient but still efficient sewer system, the sanitation problem is not nearly so bad as might be supposed, given the number and character of the residents.

Since most denizens of Delastarion are uncomfortable in daylight, the town is most active at night and all but shuts down during the bright hours of the afternoon. After dark, scattered lanterns light the streets and major thoroughfares adequately for the low-light vision common among the goblins and their kin. The guards carry torches, but they are at a disadvantage in the unlit alleyways and lanes of the goblin slums, a fact that encourages lawlessness after the sun sets.

## Population and Governance



## Districts

### The West Wall

The Talonnin River runs west of Delastarion and the ancient foundations of the west wall were laid at the top of a granite bluff above the river. Since then, erosion has gnawed at the base of the bluff, so the banks of the river are even closer to the wall than they were originally. However, the cliff is still sound enough to serve as a solid base for the walls. For most of the length of the west wall, the 30-foot high walls are almost directly over the 90-foot cliff face for a total drop of 120 feet from the top of the wall to the surface of the river. The towers and keep rise even higher above the water.

### Orc Shanty-Town

Northwest of town is the noisome camp of the orcs, who are only allowed into town in small groups, heavily escorted.

### Castle

This is Gorbast's stronghold. Its foundations are massive blocks of the green stone, on which Telenar stonemasons built up granite walls and towers. These were heavily damaged in the last defense of Delastarion, but have been stoutly repaired in many places, particularly a large gap that was opened in the north wall between the outboard gate tower and the wall defense tower.

Nevertheless, the castle is strong enough to secure its master as the law in Delastarion. Gorbast's ogre guard and other henchmen are stationed here in garrison buildings that stretch along the inside of the south wall.

### Delastarion Castle

Gorbast's Keep is the seat of power. It is here that the ogre-king lives, holds court, administers what passes for justice, plots shakedowns, and generally knocks heads as needed to keep things running smoothly.

### The North Gate

Like the South Gate, the North Gate is solidly built and heavily guarded. It is the usual entrance for caravans and miner parties, so the primary concern of its watch is to prevent conflicts between the various goblin tribes that come together here. To that end, Gorbast has detailed Gedrog, a war-troll, to the command of Hrudnaur, the half-orc captain charged to be captain of the gate guard. Hrudnar and Gedrog have formed a mutually-beneficial relationship by which they intimidate and cheat those who seek entrance by their gate.

### The Northwest Quarter

This part of town is dominated by the Hellbound Company, hobgoblin mercenaries led by Dakar, a freelance commander. The Hellbound are mostly deserters and renegades from the armies of various overlords who drifted to Delastarion the early days of the monster occupation. They have the advantage of tenure over the Bloodeagles, but they are considerably less disciplined or reliable. Dakar, in particular, is prone to drunkeness and rash decision-making. He leads mostly because he has the loyalty of Nardran, an elite warcaster and longtime comrade-in-arms.

Call to Arms (NW1)

Proprieter: Granrar

The Call to Arms was the first inn to open after the monsters took Delastarion. It's proprietor, Granrar, is a hobgoblin wayfinder who was among the first to scout the area when it was still under the control of the Telenar and was also among the first to recognize its commercial potential after the Telenar were driven out. Ganrar retains the shaggy appearance and rough manners typical of hobgoblin mountain men, but he has a stake in multiple enterprises across town and is quite wealthy. Granrar has become increasingly more reclusive as his wealth has grown. He mostly does business out of the back room and leaves the day-to-day operations of the tavern to Vikwer, a hobgoblin commander who was with the original invasion force.

This tavern is the off-duty hangout for the soldiers of the Hellbound Company. There are generally a number of them here, drinking agrash and engaging in endless games of lagrak. A number of hobgoblin slatterns work the tables as hostesses. The actual preparation and serving of food and drink is left to goblin slaves.

The Raven's Eye (NW2)

Manager: Hridgar

This tavern is effectively the officer's club of the Hellbound Company. The manager, Hridgar, was an orderly of Lord Margrond's who took leave of the army and stayed behind in Delastarion. The company pays him a salary to keep gnardragur (spicy organ-meat pie) on the table and agrash (rough ale) and srathgul (a harsh liquor) flowing at the Raven's Eye. He is assisted in this by a compliment of hobgoblin slatterns and a crew of goblin slaves.

The Northeast Quarter

This section is the dwelling place of the town's more prosperous goblins, mostly merchants and representatives of the mining clans, and their slaves and guardians.

Krashnar the Slave-Trader

Krashnar, a former centurion of Lord Margrond's command, is one of the major slave-traders in town. Dissatisfied with the quantity and quality of goblin slaves coming onto the market from tribal wars, Krashnar began to organize slave-raids against the goblin tribes east of the Celedonnin River. Due to the greatly weakened condition of the tribes in the aftermath of the Blood Moon Uprising, Krashnar's raids this season have been very successful and demand from the dark dwarves has ensured a handsome profit from each raid. Krashnar is quickly becoming one of the wealthiest merchants in town and his ambitions are growing apace.

To ingratiate himself with Bar-Krogroshir's power elites, Krashnar has begun to host parties and entertainments.

Update

Fernie and Fargrim's gate-crashing on Krashnar's party resulted in Gruthgrash absconding with 200 GP of the adventurer's money. Aware of the adventurers' reputation, Gruthgrash went immediately to the Northwest Quarter, where he plans to lay low at the Call to Arms until he can land a position as a guard with a hunting party in the northwest forest. He has army buddies among the mercenaries of the Hellbound Regiment, but he will tell them only that he has offended Krashnar and needs to get out of town until things blow over.

### The West Quarter

This part of town has come to be the dwelling place of the town's duergar contingent - merchants, miners, craftsmen and their guards. The duergar keep goblin slaves and bugbear overseers and thugs. They also are allied with a small number of dark ones, who serve them as spies and assassins as they pursue their own opaque agenda.

The Searing Iron (W1)

Proprietor: Aelgrim Druthmar

This tavern, named after an instrument of torture, is built of stone in the fashion of a castle keep. It caters to a clientele of duergar. The building and its interior is typical of the duergar - craftsmanlike, but dark and cruel. The entertainment is cruel as well, usually consisting of the torture of some hapless captive.

The proprieter, Aelgrim Druthmar, is an unsavory character, even for a duergar. He is covered in diabolic tattoos, wears black plaited leather armor at all times, and sports knives of various sizes and types, all with cruelly jagged edges and spiked hilts. His eyes burn with dark fire and his claws smoke when he is angry, which is fairly often. He is the current leader of the duergar criminal syndicate The Sons of Avernus. Aelgrim's gang conducts unlicensed gambling and prostituition operations in the West Quarter and have begun to expand into the Southeast Quarter, which brings them in to conflict with Ungerd's gang. They plan to eventually muscle in on Gorbast's other franchises, especially the slave trade. The Iron, as it is called, is the hub of their activities. Except during the weekly "entertainments", strangers who chance in are made to feel unwelcome and those who ask too many questions are looking for a stomping.

Aelgrim and his top enforcers, Halnrad and Vigrath, hail from the city of Akaragraashar, beneath the Mountain of Fire.

Update

Gurshlag, the sole hobgoblin survivor of Narglatz's attempted hit on the party, took the desperate gamble that Aelgrim would hide him from Ungerd in exchange for information. He was right, but not in the way he intended. Aelgrim is indeed hiding Gurshlag -- in the torture-chamber beneath the tavern, where he is extracting information from the hobgoblin in his own preferred manner. By this means, Aelgrim knows of Naglatz's double-dealings with Ungerd. He suspects that Gorbast was on the other end, but he doesn't know for sure. In any event, Aelgrim is moving to exploit Ungerd's misfortune and the Sons of Avernus will have an increasing presence in the Southeast Quarter in the days to come.

Hrothrad's Ale Hall (W2)

Proprietor: Hrothrad Hargrond

This stone building features an open court, filled with long benches and outdoor firepits. Hrothrad is significantly less grim than most duergar and the atmosphere of his tavern approaches cheer at times. This is advanced by the entertainment -- slave-women of various races, including dwarves, forced to serve tankards of ale to the patrons and suffer whatever abuse the latter care to mete out in return. Outright killing or mutilation of the slaves is forbidden, due to their value, and the duergar are as sexually reserved as their dwarven cousins, but pretty much anything else is permitted. Patrons vie with each other to inflict the most humiliation on the serving-wenches, to the merriment of their comrades.

### The East Quarter

The East Quarter is the town's slum. It saw heavy damaged during the siege and is crowded with ramshackle huts, crudely repaired buildings, unreconstructed ruins, and temporary shelters, the dwellings of the goblin underclass. The pavers and cobblestones have long since been appropriated as building materials, so the streets and byways are ankle-deep mud during the spring rains. Here alone the well-engineered sewer cannot accommodate the volume of debris and offal. The resulting stench permeates the district and frequently wafts into adjoining neighborhoods.

Most of the goblins here are Klezra who came to work the mines, but through ambition or misfortune ended up here. Many are slaves disabled by some accident and dismissed by their owners to die. Others are outcasts from their tribes who are seeking their fortunes. The goblins brought their pets too, everything from drakes to wolverines, and this tends to hold down the population of rats and their larger cousins.

There are few if any established businesses in the East Quarter. Such commerce as exists takes place in the narrow streets and tangled alleys. Merchandise and vice alike are offered by street sellers and it is not uncommon for a vendor to turn robber if the opportunity presents itself. Interestingly, there are no beggars. Charity is utterly alien to the goblin mindset, so asking for alms would not only be unprofitable, but dangerous too.

Pushdug the Shaman (E1)

In one of the East Quarter's many hovels lives a hermit shaman who is known among the goblins for his holiness. He is said to be constantly in communication with the ancestors. Visitors to his shack and even his acolytes are sometimes driven away with harsh words and sometimes with blows of his staff, but occasionally, the hexer will stare sightlessly and utter prophecy or blessings in an unearthly voice.

Several of Pushdug's acolytes will usually be in the immediate vicinity of the hovel, hoping that the seer will speak. They bring him food and protect him from curious onlookers.

6 Goblin Hexers (Level 3 Controller) - Acolytes

Pushdug does not have much in the way of worldly possessions. However, within a bundle of rags that he uses for a pillow, he has the gold-plated skull of a goblin. Its crown is inscribed with a circle of dwarf runes. This is the Skull of Oaths, but Pushdug does not know it as such. He believes that it is a relic sacred to the ancestors and that sleeping on it brings him visions wherein he can discern the will of the ancestors.

Garsharak the Lupine Farrier

A cluttered shop that was once an outbuilding houses Garsharak and his apprentice, who make worg and wolf saddles and associated tack. Grashrak learned his trade while attached to Lord Margrond's calvary.

Fargrath the Lupine Trainier

Fargrath and his apprentice (his son) train wolves as guards and mounts. They have set up business in a decrepit stable that has seen little repair, but the 10-foot high wattle fence that surrounds the corral is new and strong. They were members of a goblin tribe from the eastern plains of Dhoar that sent wolf-rider scouts as auxiliaries to Lord Margrond's invasion force.

Goblin Sharpshooter (Level 2 Artillery) - Fargrath (Master)

Lugrush the Smith

After the fall of the keep, Lugrush claimed a smithy that had been commandeered by a field-unit of hobgoblin engineers. The building escaped serious damage during the Orc Mutiny and so Lugrush was able to build one of the first stable businesses in Bar-Krorgroshir. He can repair or manufacture most common iron work and often is in the market to buy scrap iron and steel.

Goblin Underboss (Level 4 Elite Controller) - Lugrush (Master)

### The Market Quarter

This district consists of the town market and its immediate surrounds, which are not necessarily distinct from their adjoining districts. As such, the market is a mingling-place among the denizens of Delastarion. In particular, representatives of the goblin tribes of Dhoar meet here on neutral ground to trade among each other and with the other races. The square is also home to a thriving slave-market.

The market is neutral ground between the Bloodeagles and the Hellbound, but the taverns and houses of ill-repute that cater to hobgoblins are careful to keep members of the two factions apart and the ogre guards are particularly vigilant on the same account.

The Slave Market (M1)

Gorbast's administration licenses the slave market and collects a fee for each transaction. His agent, a particularly shrewd and capable goblin hexer named Kruchlarg, conducts the auctions.

Goblin Slave Hexer (Level 7 Elite Controller) - Kruchlarg

The Baracoon (M2)

Slaves destined for sale on the market are kept here. Owners can leave slaves here for security while trading in town. Slaves can also be sent here for training or discipline (to include flogging and even torture). All these services are available for a fee collected by Gorbast's agent. Security is likewise provided by Gorbag's thugs.

Higlaf's Metalworks (M3)

This is a combination smithy and general repair shop run by an independent-minded duergar named Higlaf Hrorlad. Higlaf is assisted by a crew of goblin metalworkers. His silent partner in the business is a renegade gnome named Glarmid Glandornin, who is content to stay out of sight in the second floor of the shop, which is just as well since goblins have a deep racial enmity toward gnomes. Between the two of them, Higlaf and Glarmid can make just about any normal metal item and can even repair magical ones.

Higlaf was drawn to the area in the hope of discovering the lost arts of working adamantium and mithril. Although he is as cruel as the next duergar, Higlaf is more interested in the study of metalcraft than in plotting and treachery.  His residence in Delastarion affords him the opportunity to live outside the toxic hierarchy of duergar society and he has no intention of ever going back to his homeland. Approached carefully, Higlaf might provide useful insight into the origins and motivations of the duergar.

Zanatha's Palace of Delight (M4)

An establishment catering mostly to the hobgoblin mercenary contingent, Zantha's Palace is a two-story building (formerly an inn called The Green Wyvern) one of the few such structures that was unscathed. This was, in fact, partly due to the influence of Zanatha herself, who was at the time a favorite of Lord Margrond, the hobgoblin general in command of the irregular forces that overran the town. Seizing the opportunity to live outside the constraints of hobgoblin hierarchy, Zanatha connived Margrond to order that the inn be spared from plunder and deeded to her after the division of spoils. Zanatha convinced a sizable contingent of the camp followers of Margrond's hobgoblin troops to join her in exile. She also inveigled Gorbast to provide protection, currently in the form of two ogre bouncers. In consideration of this, Gorbast receives a cut of the Palace's revenues.

Zanatha is careful to avoid getting tangled up in the contention between the Bloodeagles and the Hellbound. However, the rivalry has crept within her very walls. Her top girl, Hymrana, has long been a favorite of Dakar's, but Edrech has secretly won the heart of her challenger, a newcomer named Nydranu. If Nydranu supplants Hymrana, Edrech stands to gain a valuable source of inside information on the Hellbound leader and his plans.

Age catches up to hobgoblin women like a freight train. These days, Zanatha is flabby, hairy and hideous, but she tries to maintain her mystique by receiving visitors only in her boudoir and speaking from behind a silk screen. Her dusky voice has lost none of its seductive charm (in Goblin anyway) and her cunning has only increased. She has networks of recruiters operating in hobgoblin cities such as Der-Hrothgrosh and Der-Surnaur who feed her operation with hobgoblin girls who are tricked or even kidnapped into the trade. She also has a talent for developing her girls' talents and exploiting their rivalries to her own advantage.

Even with Gorbast taking a sizable chunk of her profits, Zanatha is wealthy. She spends a great deal of it on bribes, hirelings and shrewd investments in order to secure her position in Delastarion. She uses the rest to support a luxurious lifestyle and to pursue her obsession, which is to find a way to reverse the effects of age. In fact, the latter preoccupation led her to make a pact with the dark fey powers a number of years ago. In exchange for her powers and the promise that one day the secret of the hag power Change Shape will be revealed to her, Zanatha passes information to her handlers and occasionally performs some service for them.

Zanatha wears a talisman bracelet of jet beads set in silver (worth 150 GP) given to her by her dark fey sponsor. She can use this three times only to summon an Umbral Sprite Swarm to her defense. The summons is a minor action. The sprite swarm will appear in a square adjacent to Zanatha at the beginning of the next round. She also wears a gold necklace set with a flawless ruby worth 5, 000 GP, which Lord Margrond gave to her in the days of her youth and beauty. She still loves him and the great hope of her heart is to regain her looks and win him back.

The Orc Hunt (M5)

The ruins of the Orc Hunt are here. The foundations of the building can be recognized by the inscription "sons of Thorol" in dwarf-runes on the fire-damaged cornerstone of a burned-out building. The doors and windows are boarded up and the roof is collapsed. Inside, the floor is a litter of charred beams and debris. Goblin transients were squatting here until they were driven out. Some of them cleared the way to the cellar (Dungeoneering DC 17 to find their entrance) and a few were killed when the floor-beams above them collapsed.

Moving around inside the abandoned building is dangerous (d20 for each 5 squares of movement)

The secret compartment in the cellar is hidden behind a panel that appears to be just another stone in the cellar wall, but which swings out when a catch along the bottom of its face is released (Perception DC 35 to find). Behind it is an iron safe door, much rusted (Thievery DC 35 to open). What appear to be a decorative panels above and below the safe conceal the vents of a poison-gas trap (Perception DC 23 to notice, Thievery DC 30 to disable). A successful attempt to disable the trap receveals that it is already disabled. An unsuccessful attempt triggers the trap (close blast 1, +14 vs. Fortitude, 3d8 + 6 poison damage, ongoing 10 poison damage (save ends); 2nd round - close blast 3, +12 vs. Fortitude, 2d8 + 4 poison damage, ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends); 3rd round - close blast 5, +10 vs. Fortitude, 1d8 + 2 poison damage; for the next 3 minutes, any creature that starts its turn in the cellar will take 1d6 poison damage.

The safe is empty except for a lagrak tile (the Red Rogue) with the character 'A' scratched into its back. This is the calling-card of Arenor, which he used in his heyday.

### The South Gate

A solid gatehouse set in the southeast wall between two corner horseshoe-shaped wall towers, the south gate provides access to the river-docks. It is kept open except during the afternoons. Mercenary hobgoblin archers man the tower. All travelers incoming or outgoing must present themselves to Hrakrad, the hobgoblin gatekeeper, just outside the gate. Hrakrad's ogre enforcers and their half-orc handlers stand ready to drop the gate portcullis and bar the massive timber doors at his signal, which he will give at the merest hint of trouble. Hrakrad's job is dangerous, but he is a renegade Fleshcarver who is eager (indeed, a little too eager) to stand the challenge. His manner is brusque, he takes offense readily and his halberd is always ready to hand. Gorbast keeps Hrakrad well-satisfied because his belligerent attitude and well-honed combat skills tend to weed out troublemakers before they ever enter the town gates.

Update

Hrakrad's untimely death in a duel with Fargrim left an opening for a new gatekeeper. Gorbast will replace him with a half-orc named Thurug, a trusted lieutenant who is the obvious choice for the position. In fact, Thurug is in the pay of Ungerd. Through his contacts at Zanatha's Palace, Edrech knows of this association. In fact, Edrech goaded Fargim into the affair to curry favor with the kingpin and get revenge for an earlier slight by Hrakrad.

Now that Ungerd has put a price on the adventurer's heads, Thurug will move to collect the bounty. He does not know of Qetra's hand in things, but he is in a position to put the pieces together if he becomes aware that the attempted Goblintown hit on the party was ordered by the late Narglatz (who he knows to have been in Gorbast's pay) rather than by Ungerd himself. Other than the party themselves, the only person who knows of Narglatz's role is Gurshlag, the hobgoblin goon whom the party spared and interrogated after the hit failed.

### The South Quarter

This quarter is mainly occupied by hobgoblin mercenaries. It is probably the most orderly part of the whole town. The streets are kept clear, the houses have been repaired or replaced by log garrison cabins with stone foundations and new shake roofs.

There are two rival companies of hobgoblin mercenaries in Delastarion. This quarter is the territory of the Bloodeagle Regiment, led by none other than Edrech, the adventurers' acquaintance from the ruins of Sheurazak. The hobgoblin adventurer and his company arrived relatively recently, but with their wealth and with the aid of Qetra, who wants to offset the power of the Hellbound Regiment, the Bloodeagles have carved a niche for themselves in Delastarion's power structure.

The Bloodeagle Regiment Garrison (S1)

Soon after their arrival, Edrech procured a former warehouse as quarters for his soldiers. The building had an outer courtyard with high walls, which the mercenaries promptly repaired and fortified. The following spring, they adapted the warehouse building itself to make it more habitable.

### The Southeast Quarter

This district is home to the town's rivermen, longshoremen, and free travelers. It is at once more prosperous and tougher in its own way than the East Quarter. It is the most racially mixed part of town, with hobgoblins, goblins, bugbears and even more wicked creatures all rubbing shoulders under the watchful eye of Gorbast's ogre guards and their half-orc handlers.

The Fin and Feather (SE1)

The Fin, as its regular patrons call it, is a rough tavern built from the remains of a boat maker's workshop that the goblins fired when they took the town. The thick log walls took little damage and the roof was easily refurbished, so Bargarak, the half-orc former gladiator who runs the place, sprinkled some wood-chips around the floor, set up some long benches and tables, and began serving agrash, home-brew ale, and a harsh poteen called "whitewater" to the mixed crowd that frequents the river-docks. His five serving-wenches seem to be humans, but they are not slaves. Rather, they are were-rats -- sisters who were born as lycanthropes and lived in the sewers of Delastarion before its fall. Bargarak befriended them during his own adventuring days and convinced them to come out from underground and live as free creatures in the open air -- something that would be possible only here.

The sisters, Nesella, Avarane, Lunalla, Genedara and Beyonne, are used to a rough crowd and are not reluctant to show their natural, hybrid forms or even their dire rat forms if necessary. They wear frontier knives (short swords) strapped to their thighs beneath their homespun dresses. More than one former patron of the Fin bears scars that attest to their readiness to use them. When in human form, their thin faces, sharp noses, buck teeth and long, sharp nails offer a hint as to their lycanthropic forms. Having grown up in the sewers beneath Delastarion, the sisters are a treasure trove of information about them.

Bargarak also employs two hobgoblin fleshcarvers as bouncers. They bear the brands of a dishonorable discharge on their faces, the penalty for an unauthorized duel they were scheduled to fight with each other. In the stockade together, the two became the best of friends. After their banishment from their homeland, they made their way Dhoar, where they met Bargarak, who convinced them to come to Delastarion, where a hobgoblin's past is in the past.

Hargrond's Wayhouse (SE2)

The owner of this two-story inn, a former barracks, is a hobgoblin battleshaper who was banished from the court of Der-Surnaur after ending up on the wrong side of one if its interminable power struggles. Having changed his name and appearance, Hargrond's strategy is to hide in plain sight. There aren't many travelers who come through Delastarion and are in need of lodging, but the ones who do pass through are generally worth knowing. Hargrond seeks to ingratiate himself with adventurer-types and often knows useful tidbits of information, which he will pass along for a suitable fee.

Hargrond distrusts other goblins and will have none on his staff. His servants are female human slaves he bought at bargain prices at the market because they were adults. He jests that they were "too ugly to be whores", although two of them, Narana and Selennia, are strikingly beautiful by human standards, despite their reduced circumstances. His trusted aide is Kesheera, a longtooth shifter who has recruited Halsaan and Turuuk, members of her tribe, to serve as Hargrond's household guard and occasional goon squad.

Ungerd's Warehouse (SE3)

Ungerd, called "the Sharp", is a hobgoblin deserter who landed in Delastarion after a short career as an adventurer. He has contacts all over Delastarion and is usually able to broker any kind of deal or locate any kind of item available in the town. Gorbag knows Ungerd and does not trust him. Indeed, the ogre boss would like nothing better than to see the hobgoblin dead, but Gorbag considers it too risky to act directly and so has adopted a strategy of containment.

Ungerd's headquarters is a warehouse for goods bound upriver. Here he and his henchmen meet to plot their nefarious activities. Some of Ungerd's lieutenants have begun taken on underlings of their own, so the group has become something of a rogues' guild in the making.

### South Riverfront

The raft traffic along the Celadonnin and Talonnin rivers ties up and loads and unloads here. Many of the raftsmen and teamsters are hobgoblins or half-orcs, but there is an enclave of goblins. Here too are a few wiry, furtive humans, who seem to have found a place beside the other races. These, in fact, are wererats, most of whom lived hidden among Delastarion's human population before the fall and weathered the siege in the sewers and secret tunnels beneath the city, and emerged afterward in small groups afterward.

Dennilon's Headquarters (SR1)

Wererats make natural rivermen, so it is no surprise that one of them rose to be the boss of the river traffic. In human form, Dennilon appears as a middle-aged man with thinning, straight black hair, squint features and a sleek, well-fed frame. He exacts franchise fees from all the rivermen and teamsters and, in turn, pays protection to Gorbast. His lieutenants are all were-rats, but many of his henchmen and enforcers are hobgoblins and half-orcs. Dennelon can usually be found in his headquarters, a single-story building near the riverfront wharves.

The Rivercombers (SR2)

Among the poorest of the town's residents are the goblins that live in a clutter of ramshackle shanties near the west wall of the South Riverfront. These goblins scrape out a living by cutting up driftwood to sell as firewood in town and by panning for gold, placers of which exist in meager amounts at the confluence of the rivers. They also occasionally find bodies and body-parts flushed out of the town's sewers after a heavy rain. This is what brought the Skull of Oaths briefly into the possession of Grishaak, one of the goblin rivercombers.

### The Wererat Camp

The island south of town where the Talonnin joins the Celadonnin is large enough and high enough to be permanently above water, even during the peak flows of the spring. A grove of ash trees and brush stands in its center. Hidden away in the briars, the town's wererats have a small camp where they meet for secret business away from the bustle of the town.
