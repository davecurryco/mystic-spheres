## Divisions of Humankind

### Alhrain

The city states of Pashan are populated by humans of an ethnic group called the _Alhrain_. They are darker than the Juchin, but not so swarthy as the Khemez. Like the Khemez, many Alhran have curly hair, but it is more often brown than black and their eyes can be light brown, green, or even blue. Their women can be especially striking -- long-lashed, narrow-waisted beauties with lush breasts and hips.

The Alhrain people tend to be energetic and passionate, especially in matters political and religious. They are more inclined to be merchants, sailors, or traders than farmers or herdsmen.

### Juchin

The _Juchin_ are descendents of the horse nomads of the Golden Hills. They are usually light-skinned, although they tan readily to a golden bronze. Their straight hair is black and their eyes are dark -- black or chestnut brown with epicanthic folds. Their noses are broad and flat and they tend to high cheekbones and thick lips.

Despite their barbaric origins, the Juchin are typically intelligent and enterprenureal.

### Khemez

The Khemez thickly populate the Ghalez river valley and Plain of Ashram. They are generally swarthy, with wavy black hair, dark eyes, bold eyebrows, and bridged nose. The men are often scrawny and typically wear thick, curly beards. The women tend to be voluptuous, if not corpulent, with abundant hair.

The Khemez people, especially the peasant farmers and rivermen along the Ghalez, are given to bovine complacency and spiritual fatalism.

### Kwanshali

The _Kwanshali_ people once had a thriving civilization on the east coast of Arestor, but this was destroyed by the Azruun. After the fall of the Azruun Empire, the Kwanshali repopulated the ruined towns and cities of Hannenar. Kwanshali tribes that reverted to savagery inhabit the hill-country of Hannenar and the coastal jungles of Ophar. Dark skinned, with straight black hair and black eyes, the Kwanshali are of medium height. Both sexes tend to be thin-hipped and paunchy, although the warriors of the barbarian tribes are often broad-shouldered and muscular.

Animism and profligate polytheism have marked Kwanshali culture and even at their most civilized, they tend to be supersitious. 

### Telenar

The _Telenar_ sailed from across the Western Sea to settle Essealona less than 1,500 years before the present. A thousand years later, they colonized the mid-west coast of Arestor. They are fair of skin and tend to black hair and grey eyes, although lighter hair and green or even blue eyes are common among them. The men are typically lean and broad-shouldered and the women willowy, if small-breasted. Their faces are clear-browed and straight-nosed, with square jaws and somewhat thin lips.

The Telenar tend to be intrepid, independent, and forthright.

## Human History

Human scholars divide their history according to the dominant civilization of the time period. Human historical records do not extend further back than the early dynasties of the Old Kingdom.

## Human Languages

Humans have the widest linguistic diversity among the races. Over the millenia, each major nation evolved its own distinct language and regional dialects thrive within those. In western Arestor, the Common language of Essealona is spoken among humans, halflings, dwarves, and gnomes. Common is widespread as a trade language in the coastal city-states of Khanashar, and in the capital city, Khanengul. Some merchants and sailors of Ilshan and Hannesh speak Common, but it is virtually unknown in Ophar and Khazgad.
