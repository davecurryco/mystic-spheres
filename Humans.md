## Human Subraces

### Alhrain

The city states of Pashan are populated by humans of an ethnic group called the _Alhrain_. They are darker than the Juchin, but not so swarthy as the Khemez. Like the Khemez, many Alhran have curly hair, but it is more often brown than black and their eyes can be light brown, green, or even blue. Their women can be especially striking -- long-lashed, narrow-waisted beauties with lush breasts and hips.

The Alhrain people tend to be energetic and passionate, especially in matters political and religious. They are more inclined to be merchants, sailors, or traders than farmers or herdsmen.

### Juchin

The _Juchin_ are descendents of the horse nomads of Kazgad and the Golden Hills. They are usually light-skinned, although they tan readily to a golden bronze. Their straight hair is black and their eyes are dark -- black or chestnut brown with epicanthic folds. Their noses are broad and flat and they tend to high cheekbones and thick lips. Men and women alike tend to be stocky, but, especially in noble families, the women are often possessed of a willowy grace and beauty.

Despite their barbaric origins, the Juchin are typically intelligent and enterprenureal.

### Khemez

The Khemez thickly populate the Ghalez river valley and Plain of Ashram. They are generally swarthy, with wavy black hair, dark eyes, bold eyebrows, and bridged noses. The men are often scrawny and typically wear thick, curly beards. The women tend to be voluptuous, if not corpulent, with abundant hair.

The Khemez people, especially the peasant farmers and rivermen along the Ghalez, are given to bovine complacency and spiritual fatalism.

### Kwanshali

The _Kwanshali_ people once had a thriving civilization on the east coast of Arestor, but this was destroyed by the Azruun. After the fall of the Azruun Empire, the Kwanshali repopulated the ruined towns and cities of Hannenar. Kwanshali tribes that reverted to savagery inhabit the hill-country of Hannenar and the rocky coasts. Dark skinned, with wavy or curly black hair and black eyes, the Kwanshali are of medium height. Both sexes tend to be thin-hipped and paunchy, although the warriors of the barbarian tribes are often broad-shouldered and muscular.

Animism and profligate polytheism have marked Kwanshali culture. Even at their most civilized, they tend to be supersitious and tribalistic.

### Quetalpa

The _Quetalpa_ have mahogany skin, straight black hair, prominent cheekbones, and aquiline noses. The tribal people are typically lean and short of stature and their women rapidly become uncomely as they age.

Whether in the city or the jungle, the Quetalpa have an unfortunate penchant for internecene warfare, which has stunted their civilization. Many Quetalpa kingdoms have ascended to dominate their neighbors, only to collapse due to internal struggles.

### Indhrus

The _Indrus_ once ruled over all of Ophar, but their advanced civilization crumbled a few centuries before the rise of the Azruun Empire. Today, a remnant of their race holds power in Tolengul, where they can be distinguished from their Quetalpa slaves by their lighter skin, taller stature, and finer features. The men of Tolengul are muscular and the women lush of hip, although small of bust.

The remaining Indrus are inbred and have an unfortunate tendency to ennui and madness. However, many of the Indrus bloodlines carry arcane talent. Magic users, particularly sorcerers, are more common among them than any other population of humankind. Deadly rivalries among the noble families of Tolengul, exacerbated by the insidious influence of Yuan-ti infiltrators, have prevented the resurgence of Indrus civilization.

### Telenar

The _Telenar_ sailed from across the Western Sea to settle Essealona less than 1,500 years before the present. A thousand years later, they colonized the mid-west coast of Arestor. They are fair of skin and tend to black hair and grey eyes, although lighter hair and green or even blue eyes are common among them. The men are typically lean and broad-shouldered and the women willowy, if small-breasted. Their faces are clear-browed and straight-nosed, with square jaws and somewhat thin lips.

The Telenar tend to be intrepid, independent, and forthright.

## Human History

Human scholars divide their history according to the dominant civilization of the time period. Human historical records do not extend further back than the early dynasties of the Old Kingdom.

## Human Languages

Humans have the widest linguistic diversity among the races. Over the millenia, each major nation evolved its own distinct language and regional dialects thrive within those. In western Arestor, the Common language of Essealona is spoken among humans, halflings, dwarves, and gnomes. Common is widespread as a trade language in the coastal city-states of Pashan, and in the capital city of Khanashar, Khanengul. Some merchants and sailors of Ilshan and Hannesh speak Common, but it is virtually unknown among the barbarian tribes of Ophar and Khazgad.
