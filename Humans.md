## Human Languages

Humans have the widest linguistic diversity among the races. Over the millenia, each major nation evolved its own distinct language and regional dialects thrive within those. In western Arestor, the Common language of Essealona is spoken among humans, halflings, dwarves, and gnomes. Common is widespread as a trade language in the coastal city-states of Khanashar, and in the capital city, Khanengul. Some merchants and sailors of Ilshan and Hannesh speak Common, but it is virtually unknown in Ophar and Khazgad.
