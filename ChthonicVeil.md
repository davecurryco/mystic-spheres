# Chthonic Veil

_6th-level abjuration_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of nacre)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

An iridescent curtain of pale light forms a vertical translucent wall-up to 20 feet long, 20 feet high, and tissue-thin. The veil remains in place for the duration. If you position the veil so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature or object, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.

The veil sheds dim light out to a range of 5 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through the veil without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 5 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be disoriented for 1 minute. While so disoriented, the creature automatically goes last in initiative order and has disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws and ability checks.

The veil shimmers with three colors, which you must chose from the following options. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the veil, it must pass through the colors one at a time in a random sequence.

The veil can be destroyed, one randomly-chosen color at a time. The color is determined after the creature attempting to destroy the veil announces the attack. Once a color is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A _rod of cancellation_ destroys a _chthonic veil_ and an _antimagic field_ temporarily suppresses its effects.

**1. Green.** The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is afflicted with a disease as per the _contagion_ spell. The disease takes effect immediately and lasts for 1 day. This color is destroyed by casting _lesser restoration_ or an equivalent spell of equal or greater level. It may also be destroyed by dealing at least 20 radiant damage to it.

**2. Yellow.** The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 8d8 poison damage or half as much damage on a successful save. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, it is also poisoned for 1 day. A _passwall_ spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal through a solid surface, destroys this color.

**3. White.** The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 8d8 cold damage or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, it is also slowed for 1 day. This color can be destroyed by dealing at least 20 fire damage to it.

**4. Blue.** The creature takes 5d10 force damage. If this attack reduces the target to 50 hit points or fewer, it is banished for 1 minute as per the _banishment_ spell. While this color is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. This color can be destroyed by dealing at least 20 force damage to it.

**5. Purple.** The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target falls unconscious for 1 minute or until the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. On waking, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is frightened of some creature type for 1 hour. You choose the type when you cast this spell. This color is destroyed by a _dispel magic_ spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

**6. Orange.** The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is affected by confusion for 1 minute as per the _confusion_ spell. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, it is also afflicted with a long-term madness. This color is destroyed by a _find the path_ spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

**7. Red.** The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 8d8 slashing damage or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, it afflicted with slow, unstoppable bleeding for 1 day. A creature gains 1 level of exhaustion for each 8 hours it is afflicted with this bleeding. This color is destroyed by casting _cure wounds_ or an equivalent spell of equal or greater level.
