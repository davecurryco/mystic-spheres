# Lost Valley

A 5e adventure for 4 14th level characters

# Background

In the days of the Old Kingdom, the dwarves of the Southern Kindred delved mines in the mountains above the north side of the valley they called Khedred-mahar, the Hidden Valley. The lands on the south side of the valley were covered in lush jungle and roamed by huge beasts that had survived from prehistoric times. Bands of hostile grungs stalked the dense cover of the lowlands and the primitive villages of lizard-folk dotted the hills. These lands the dwarves wisely left alone -- save to journey warily back through the Hidden Pass bearing hoarded ingots of gold and silver to seek wives among their kin.

To open trade with the human lands to the west, the dwarves delved a tunnel beneath the mountains. The commerce was rich and in the days of the Kingdom of Sarnakad, human traders established a trading post called Sarnad at the valley terminus of the Golden Tunnel. Sarnad grew into a large city and human towns sprung up all along the north side of the valley to serve the needs of the dwarves who labored in the mines above.

Things went well until they didn't. Madrezakar IV ("The Unlucky") began excavation of another tunnel, this one to carry water to the dry hills of Sarnakad. The attempt ended in a disaster that flooded the valley basin around the fledgling city of Mendra and drowned the dwarven halls of Khazaz-druul. Bullywugs promptly infested the resulting swamp and hindered Madrezakar's efforts to drain it. Worse, a band of Yuan-ti took advantage of the situation to slip into the hills south of the valley and establish secret bases from which they sent infiltrators into the human settlements. The fruit of their efforts was an escalation of blood-feuds among the merchant-houses of the valley. This civil unrest spurred the King of Sarnakad to close the western terminus of the Tunnel. Ulitmately, Sarnad was ripped apart in an spree of violence and looting triggered by a series of assassinations perpetrated by Yuan-ti infiltrators. From an abundance of distrust, the towns along the valley closed their gates against the refugees.

With nothing more to be gained by secrecy, the Yuan-ti revealed themselves and built a fortified town of their own, Yl'tsii, with slave-labor seized from among the displaced humans and stone ripped from the dwarven quarry at Khed-khmir. As is common with the snake-people, success spawned division and treachery. Having failed in an attempt at coup-de-etat, a faction of Yuan-ti fled Yl'tsii to establish a rival town, Yl'nyez. The snake-people made stealthy war on each other and on the grungs to their north -- strife which spared the human settlements from conquest. 

Rumors of strife amid the source of such riches must have reached the wrong ears because another calamity soon befell the Valley in the voracious form of Ezgron the Acerbic, a black dragon. The wyrm reduced the now-isolated fortress of Adrach and went on to attack the dwarven halls at Elez-druul, which ultimately fell -- howbeit to treachery rather than the dragon's wrath. Ezgron established her lair amid the ruins of Mendra and hoarded there the spoils of Adrach and Elez-druul together with the pitiful leavings of Sarnad. Kobolds multiplied like vermin among the ruins and the dragon pressed many lizard-folk into her service, but the bullywugs she hunted as they were tasty, especially with garlic.

With trade to the west cut off and passage to the east increasingly perilous, the dwarves abandoned their mines -- reluctantly since many veins of precious metal remained untapped. Reluctantly too they bribed the lizardfolk of the east valley in red gold and weapons of steel for safe passage to the mouth of the Hidden Pass. With this wealth, the chieftains of the east vally lizardfolk grew their influence and expanded their territory at the expense of the grungs and Yuan-ti -- until their rivalries broke out into war.
