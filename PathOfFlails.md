# Path of Flails

_Complex trap (level 5-10, dangerous threat)_

This 35 foot long corridor has a floor of multi-colored stone tiles in bizarre shapes and patterns. Its barrel-vaulted ceiling 10 feet high and is divided down its length by a curtain of bronze chains that runs down the length of the corridor 5 feet above the floor. The chains hang from crossbars spaced at intervals of six inches along a thick bronze rod that traverses the length of the corridor. These chains are weighted at the free end. The rod is supported at each end by an octagonal pillar of bronze and at intervals of 5 feet by pylons that descend from the ceiling. The passageways on the east and west end of the corridor are framed in bronze as well.

**Trigger.** The trap is triggered by means of scores of pressure plates concealed among the floor tiles in the center 15 feet of the corridor. It activates as soon as more than 10 pounds of pressure is applied to any of these plates. A humanoid creature is 25% likely to trigger one of the plates for each 5-foot section it walks over.

**Initiative.** The trap acts on initiatives 20 and 10.

## Active Elements.

When the trap is triggered, a hidden portcullis drops down into the door frames at either end of the corridor, each of which reveals a rune of fear above the dooway. Simultaneously, gears concealed in the pillars revolve the bronze rod rapidly. The crossbars spin with this axle like the spokes of a wheel, causing the chains to whip out under centrifugal force.    

_Portcullis._ (Initiative 20). Each portcullis drops vertically from a slot in the doorframe, blocking its doorway. This same action reveals a _rune of fear_ above the portcullis. 

_Whirling Chains._ (Initiative 20). The chains attack each creature in the corridor, with a +8 bonus to the attack roll and dealing 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

_Rune of Fear._ (Initiative 10). Each creature within 15 feet of a rune must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is frightened of the rune, and the creature must immediately use its reaction to move its speed away from the rune. The frightened creature can’t move closer to the end of the hallway where the rune is until it uses an action to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, which ends the frightened condition on itself.

## Dynamic Elements.

_Chains Miss_ The chains move with increasing speed, slowing only when they hit a target. Each time the chains miss all attacks in a round, increase their damage by 5 (1d10) and their attack bonus by +2. These benefits last until the chains hit a target.

## Constant Elements.

After the first round, the whirling chains and the rune of fear affect creatures that end their turns in the elements’ areas. The whirling chains only stay active for 10 rounds, but the runes are permanent.

## Countermeasures.

There are 5 pressure plates in each 5-foot square section of the trigger area. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check made within 5 feet of a section of the trigger area reveals a pressure plate. A subsequent DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check on the same area reveals that there are multiple pressure plates. A DC 20 Dexterity check made with thieves’ tools disables a pressure plate, but a check result of 5 or less triggers the trap. Each pressure plate disabled reduces the risk of triggering the trap in that section by 5%.

Each of the trap’s active elements also offers potential countermeasures.

_Portcullis._ A DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the hidden portcullis. A DC 16 Dexterity check made with thieves’ tools disables it, but a check result of 5 or less triggers the trap.

_Whirling Blades._ Characters can destroy or jam the chains or crossbars, or damage the axle rod. The simple expedient of securing the free end of each chain to the crossbar near the axle will provide a 2 1/2 foot path along each wall free of danger. A character can make a DC 14 Dexterity check to throw himself prone along the wall and crawl the length of the corridor without suffering any attacks. 

_Rune of Fear._ A rune can be effaced from the wall by dealing it 10 points of damage. A character who attempts this while within 5 feet of the rune makes saving throws against the rune's effects at disadvantage. Alternatively, the rune can be disabled with three successful castings of _dispel magic_ (DC 13) targeting the rune.
