# Kalii

## Geography

Kalii is the smallest of the islands of Ilshan. It is dominated by a single volcano, _Naai Akapele_. The volcano is active, but it has been many years since it last erupted in force. The shores of the island are rocky, especially on the east and north sides, where steep cliffs extend to the sea. A sheltered inlet on the southeast side affords the only practical approach by water.
