## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sailing ship makes one shortbow attack for each band of crew not occupied with the ship's movement. The sailing ship cannot multiattack on the round it makes a ram attack. 

**Ram.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 5 ft., one target (hull only) 0° forward. _Hit:_ 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage for each 10 ft. of relative speed. The attacking ship takes half of the damage dealt to the target.

**Shortbow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target (band only). _Hit:_ 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.

Large, seaworthy ships of this type are used by merchants, pirates and marines. A sailing ship’s main method of attack is with small arms distributed to the crew, as the ship itself is typically unarmed. Sailing ships have average speed, average hit points and good Seaworthiness.
