# Abbathor's Amulet

## Introduction

## Sheurazak Restored

### General Features

#### Work in Progress

Angrim's priority is to make the underground city fit for mortal habitation as soon as possible. The main gates, halls, chambers, and bridges of Sheurazak have been stabilized and repaired in workmanlike fashion. However, the cultists lack master craftsmen and fine materials. Much remains to be done if Sheurazak is to be fully restored to its former glory. However, the High Priest has no intention of restoring Sheurazak's many temples and shrines dedicated to gods other than Abbathor. Indeed, he ordered that the sites be dismantled for building stone and their entrances sealed off.

Except as noted, the underground halls and chambers are sound, adequately ventilated, and free of seepage. Areas inhabited by the cultists are lit with bright light, usually from wall-mounted lanterns.

#### Dwarven Cultists

The living dwarves who dwell in Sheurazak are under the influence of the [[Obsession|obsession]] spell that Angrim can cast using the _Heart of Abbathor_. They are not cultists in the usual sense, but they are nonetheless fanatical in their fervor to restore and protect the underground city. Angrim has indoctrinated them with the belief that uninvited outsiders are intruders who seek to interfere with The Restoration. They will lay down their lives in the defense of their cause.

The cultists tolerate close cooperation with undead only because Angrim wills it. If the effect of the _obsession_ spell on a cultist ends, the affected dwarf will most probably want to leave Sheurazak immediately.

#### Undead

Except as noted, all the undead in Sheurazak were once dwarves. Once he had established control of the city, Angrim deanimated the hobgoblin zombies and replaced them with a veritable army of skeletons recruited from the ossuaries of the Catacombs. The skeletons tend to have very specific instructions and assigned areas. Skeletons assigned to guard duties or patrols have generally been instructed to admit dwarves who say a passphrase, which varies according to zone. Skeletons assigned to work crews have usually been instructed to obey the orders of one or more individual cultists. All of the skeletons have been instructed to obey the orders of Angrim and his undead cohorts.

## South Gate

### Waterfall, Pool, and Stream

An underground spring flows into a cavern that opens on the side of a cliff to the west of the gates. The dwarves dammed the mouth of the cavern to form a wide waterfall that spills 20 feet down to a pool, which drains into the channel of a moat that runs along the base of the curtain wall. The mouth of the cavern is over 90 feet wide, but is only two feet high above the dam except at its center, where an archway 5 feet high and 10 feet high regulates overflow during the spring rains. 

### Curtain Wall and Outer Gate

Each of the watchtowers of the curtain wall is manned by 2 **skeletons** armed with crossbows, who keep lookout from the top floor. The skeletons wear mail armor with full-face helms (AC 16), so it is not apparent that they are undead. Inside each tower, a company of 10 **skeletons** armed with crossbows wait at the arrow-slits. The two gate towers on the curtain wall each have a similar compliment, with the addition of two cultist **guards** to man the gates. The gate-wardens will only admit creatures who they know to have Angrim's express permission to come and go, such as the foraging parties. If they have any doubts, they will send word to the gate-warden of the inner gate. Each watchtower has a bronze bell that the lookouts will ring to to warn of intruders.

### Inner Gate

The two gate towers of the inner gate are each manned by companies of 20 **skeletons** with an additional 4 **skeleton** watchmen. There are two ballistas atop each of the towers, which the watchmen will man after they sound the alarm. A special squad of 4 **skeletons** mans the gate under the direction of a cultist **veteran** named Gwarin, who is the gate-warden. Gwarin takes his post very seriously and will demand the passphrase of the inner gate even from those he recognizes as having permission to come and go.

### Inner Court

Beyond the inner gate is a court formed from a dry ravine. On the left side, a set of steps laid in large blocks of stone leads to a pair of stone pillars that flank an archway set in the sheer side of the cliff. A frieze above the archway is adorned with bas-relief figures of dwarves at various crafts and labors. The border beneath the frieze is carved with dwarf-runes saying (in Dwarvish):

_“Prosperity does not fall from the sky, it is mined from the rock”_

The original doors in the archway are still intact. These open inward and are made of iron treated through a secret process known to the dwarves of old that greatly slows oxidation. They have recently been laboriously scrubbed to remove any trace of rust. The doors are decorated with the design of a crescent moon crossed with a hammer.

At the head of the ravine, a stone culvert juts from the rocks 10 feet above the level of the inner court. The stone is carved in the likeness of a boar's head. This is an outlet for water from an underground stream that can be diverted to flood the inner court in case it is overrun.

## South Gate Halls

### Vestibule Chamber

Inside the doors is a vestibule chamber. Its floors are well-laid granite slabs and its ceiling arches thirty feet high over a steep stairway that leads up to a wide doorway ten feet above the level of the floor. The chamber is ringed with large stone gar’s heads with gaping jaws are set into the walls 15 feet above floor-level. These features are part of the gate defense. The dwarves bored through the rock and laid pipes that tap into an underground stream and terminate in the gar’s heads. This allows defenders to fill the chamber with water, reinforcing the doors and impeding invading troops if the doors were to be breached.

The doors at the head of the stairs are of thick oak newly-hewn and bound with iron.

### Stone Guardian Chamber

At the first T-intersaction, a 10-foot tall stone statue of a mail-clad dwarf warrior with a round shield and a hand-axe stands menacingly within an alcove. The statue is newly carved as a replacement for a stone golem that originally stood here as part of the gate defenses. However, Angrim has not yet found the time to animate it.

### Barracks Chamber

This large chamber was once a barracks for the gate guards. It is now filled with 100 **skeletons** armed with spears who are the mainstay of the gate defense.

### Cultist Guard Quarters

Several of the larger chambers are used in their original capacity as quarters, kitchen and mess hall for the cultist guards who man the gate defenses. There are 20 cultist **guards** resting and eating while off-duty. They will be unarmed unless they have had enough warning to organize and reach the armory.
