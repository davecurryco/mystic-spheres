# Myenya, The Ring of Starlight

_Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)_

The _Ring of Starlight_ was crafted by Brethilion, one of the greatest star-mages of the Aelvii. It gives its wielder the power of fate, but it also binds the fate of any creature that wears it to the fate of the line of Dialiannon the Eternal.

The ring itself is a slender band of mithril set with a single astral diamond of unique clarity, in which is captured the light of _Anulios_, the Star of Fate.

_Myenya_ properly belongs only on the hand of an incarnation of Dialiannon the Eternal and its full powers are only available to such a one. However, it will consent to be wielded by another while it seeks  the Illuvarin female destined to bear Dialiannon's incarnation in the current generation. The ring knows where the chosen one is to be found and will constantly urge its current owner along a path to rendezvous with this destined one, regardless of any dangers that may stand in the way.

The _Ring of Starlight_ was originally crafted to fight the encroachment of the Far Realm and the Sphere of Shadow into the mortal world. Thus, it has powers specifically directed against creatures native to those domains. These are among its more accessible powers, as the ring is content to use even an otherwise unsuitable wielder to carry on its fight against these ancient enemies of the Aelvii.
