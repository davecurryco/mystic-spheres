# Phoenix Circle

The _Phoenix Circle_, a human secret society with its base in Essealona, is dedicated to the principles of philosophical humanism, economic rationalism, and arcane utilitarianism. Its members act in secret to undermine the aristocracy, curtail the influence of the religious orders, and counter the forces of chaos and evil. The Circle is particularly well-represented in the upper echelons of the trade and merchant associations of Essealona and its colonies.
