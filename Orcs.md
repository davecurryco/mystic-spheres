# Orcs

Although humans often lump them together with goblinkind, Orcs are, in fact, a distinct species. There are various breeds of orcs, but there are few truly significant cultural differences between them.

Orcs are quintessential savages. They adopt bits and pieces of goblin civilization, but employ them in the context of their own violent and untameable culture. They live at the mercy of nature, but do not hesitate to despoil it given the opportunity. They have the wild instincts of wolves, but are considerably less loyal to their own kind.

As might easily be supposed, turmoil and violence is a constant feature of orc society. Left to themselves, orcs organize into small bands whose members may or may not be related to each other by blood. The strongest warrior dominates the others until he is overthrown and a new leader takes his place. Bands constantly break apart and re-form. Young males are often driven away from the band for various reasons and wander until they die or find a new band that will accept them. Bands constantly raid each other for goods and captives so it is not unusual for a band to have turnover of over 100% in a few seasons. The strongest male keeps a harem of females which he jealously defends, but the females will mate with his rivals at any opportunity to keep the paternity of their children in doubt should their current husband be deposed. This breeds hardiness and ferocity into orc stock, but also ensures that deviousness and treachery regularly surface in the gene pool as well.

As with savages everywhere, orcs are deeply impressed by the supernatural. They are not animists in the classic sense, but they do believe that spirits (mostly baneful ones) are commonplace. Orc shamans are protected by the common belief that their blood bears a curse on any who sheds it. However, this taboo does not extend to other shamans, so orc shamans are as likely to die in a duel of primal magic as orc warriors are to be killed by more ordinary sorts of violence.

## Orc History

Orcs keep no written records and even their oral traditions are short-lived. What is known of the history of orcs comes from their (usually negative) role in the histories of the other races.

## Orc Language

Orcs have their own language, which is derived from Goblin. However, Orcish is so debased from its original that the relationship is only apparent phonetically. Speakers of Orcish or Goblin can no more understand one another than can speakers of Finnish or Japanese.
