**Amorphous.** The chaos weird can move through a space as narrow as 1/4 inch wide without squeezing.

**Cold Sensitivity.** If the chaos wierd takes damage from cold, it is slowed until the end of its next turn.

**Deceptive Appearance.** While the chaos weird remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pool of liquid metal similar to mercury, except that its surface is shiny and reflective, rather than dull.

**Explosive Death.** If the chaos wierd drops to 0 hit points, it will be violently ejected back its native plane through a planar rift. Creatures within 10 feet of the chaos wierd when this happens must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 13 (3d8) force damage, or half as much on a successful one. The planar rift, which appears as a 10-foot radius sphere of violently swirling colored mists, will persist for 1d4 rounds before it vanishes.

**Magic Reflection.**  Whenever the chaos weird is the target of a magic spell or effect, the caster becomes the target instead. The elemental can still be affected by indirect targeting, such as with an area of effect.

**Magic Resistance.** The chaos wierd has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The chaos weird makes two attacks.

**Pseudopod.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the chaos wierd cannot target any other creature with its pseudopod attack.

A **chaos weird** is a creature summoned from the planes of elemental Chaos. The ritual by which it is summoned gives the chaos wierd what stability of form it has on the material plane. When a chaos wierd is killed, its substance is violently ejected back its native plane through a planar rift.
