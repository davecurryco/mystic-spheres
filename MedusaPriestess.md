**Dark Devotion.** The medusa priestess has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

**Improved Petrifying Gaze.** When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 60 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 60 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

**Serpent Weapons.** As a bonus action, the priestess can transform up to two poisonous snakes into envenomed shortswords or a swarm of snakes into 12 envenomed arrows. The effect lasts until the weapon or ammunition hits a creature or object, at which point it reverts to its original form. Roll initative for the snake, which takes its turn in the next round. The snake will attack the creature it struck previously if possible and will then slither away.

**Spellcasting.** The medusa priestess is a 7th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The medusa priestess has the following cleric and wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): _guidance, minor illusion, poison spray, thaumaturgy_  
1st level (4 slots): _animal friendship, charm person, command, disguise self, shield_  
2nd level (3 slots): _hold person, invisibility, misty step_  
3rd level (3 slots): _bestow curse, dispel magic, major image_    
4th level (1 slot): _phantasmal killer_

## A Medusa Priestesses' Lair

Medusa priestesses usually live in solitude among the overgrown ruins of a temple or shrine.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing ties) the medusa priestess takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* The medusa priestess gains the ability to move though standing stones or columns in or near her lair in a manner similar to the _tree stride_ spell. This ability lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round and the medusa priestess can use it only on her turn.
* The medusa priestess summons snakes from the surrounding area. The priestess can summon one giant constrictor snake, eight poisonous snakes, or a swarm of poisonous snakes. The summoned creatures appear in unoccupied spaces that the priestess can see within 60 feet. The summoned creatures are friendly to the priestess and her allies, are immune to her petrifying gaze, and obey her verbal commands. The summoned creatures act as a group which has its own turns on the initative count in which they were summoned. The summoned creatures disappear after 10 minutes or when the priestess takes an action to dismiss them.  

## Regional Effects

The region containing a medusa priestess' lair is affected by long exposure to her divine curse, which creates one or more of the following effects:

* Snakes are unusually abundant within 1 mile of the medusa priestess' lair and are actively hostile to intruders. Any snake in this area will telepathically alert the medusa priestess of the presence of intruders and can serve as her eyes and ears.  
* Within 1 mile of the lair, natural terrain may be covered by illusion similar to the _hallucinatory terrain_ spell as the medusa priestess wills.

**Medusa priestesses** are devotees of serpent dieties who, for some offense usually having to do with excessive pride or vanity, are punished by an immortal curse. They make a weapon of the instinctive fear of snakes that most humanoids are subject to. They also make weapons of snakes themselves.
