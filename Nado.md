# Nado

## Geography

Nado is formed from two volcanoes, but neither is as tall as Naai Akapele. The southern and northern sides of the island end in sea-cliffs and the beaches of the west side are too rocky to allow boats to land. However, the rainy east side of the island has long sections of white sand beaches and a large bay, _Nashiro Bay_.
