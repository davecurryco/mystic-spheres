# Palanor

Telenar colonists from Essealona first settled the mainland they called Arestor at the head of a peninsula on the bay of Rhon-Eleannon. They named this first settlement Esseanir and called the peninsula itself Palanor. The boundaries of Palanor are traditionally held to be the land east of the Faldonnin River and the west of the Celadonnin River extending north to the Shield Wall.

Palanor is the breadbasket of the Telenar colonies. Its interior is blessed with fertile soil and a temperate climate. Its plains are checkered with farms and the foothills to the north are ideal for the grazing of sheep. Two major harbors shelter busy ports that ship grain and meat to markets in Rothannur and Essealona.
