## Actions

**Multiattack.** The blood weird makes two attacks.

**Necrotic Spray (Recharge 5, 6).** The blood weird emits a spray of blood in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Pseudopod.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and can’t regain hit points.

**Life Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, one target grappled by the blood weird, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken, and the blood weird gains hit points equal to that amount.This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the blood weird gains hit points above its hit point maximum in this way, the extra hit points are temporary and last for 10 minutes or until they are lost due to damage. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The body of a humanoid slain in this way hemorrhages blood from all its orifices and the resulting pool of blood forms a new blood weird in 24 hours.

A **Blood Weird** is an undead creature animated by necromantic magic from the life-blood of one or more dead humanoids. When slain, a blood weird becomes an inanimate pool of blood, which immediately begins to congeal.
