**Hellshield.** The death knight’s armor and shield flicker with bluish flame. The flames confer resistance to fire, ranged weapon and spell attacks, and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons that aren’t silvered.

**Magical Resistance.** The death knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Marshal Undead.** Unless the death knight is incapacitated, it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.

**Mounted Charge.** If the death knight is mounted and moves at least 20 feet in a straight toward a creature that is the same size as or smaller than its mount and hits it with a melee attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the death knight’s mount can make one melee attack against it as a bonus action.

**Mounted Combatant.** The death knight has advantage on melee attack rolls agains any unmounted creature that is smaller than its mount. The death knight can force an attack targeted at its mount to target the death knight instead. If the death knight’s mount is subjected to an effect that allows the mount to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only takes half damage if it fails.

**Spellcasting.** The death knight is a 19th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared:

1st level (4 slots): _command, compelled duel, hellish rebuke, searing smite_  
2nd level (3 slots): _hold person, magic weapon_  
3rd level (3 slots): _counterspell, dispel magic, elemental weapon_  
4th level (3 slots): _banishment, staggering smite_  
5th level (2 slots): _destructive wave (necrotic)_

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The death knight makes three longsword attacks.

**Lance.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (1d12 + 6) piercing damage, plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.

**Longsword.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage or 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.

**Hellfire Orb (1/Day).** The death knight hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and 35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Reactions

**Parry.** The death knight adds 6 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the death knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

In life, **Destran** was an Essealonan paladin whose errantry took him to the elven realm of Asarial. There, on a hillside blooming with summer wildflowers, he saw an elven-maid dancing in the moonlight. Enchanted by her beauty, Destran called to her, but she fled frightened before him. The stricken knight-errant kept vigil that night and vowed that he would wed no other than a daughter of elven-kind, for he did not know the maiden’s name. Returning night after night to the glade where he first saw the maiden, Destran’s patience was finally rewarded with another glimpse of her loveliness. Again he called and again the elf-maiden fled. This time Destran pursued and finally caught her in his embrace. Pressed by the handsome warrior’s professions of undying love, the maiden unwisely told him her name and said that she would allow him to woo her if her father, a high lord of the elves, gave his permission.

If the maid thought to thwart Destran's courtship thereby, she reckoned without the single-minded determination of paladins. Several days later, Destran appeared at her father’s gates, somehow gained admittance to his court, and there made his case. Offended at the mortal’s presumption, but bound by codes of honor, the elf-lord assigned a seemingly-impossible task as his daughter's bride-price. Without a word, Destran mounted his charger, took up his lance and set off. Seven years later, Destran returned to the elf-lord's court with incontrovertible proof that he had accomplished the task. In classic style, the cunning fey sent Destran to perform a second, even more difficult and dangerous deed of errantry.

The paladin wandered for six years, unable even to find even the land where his quest lay. Then, when he was on the verge of despair, a seemingly chance meeting with an old crone gave Destran the clue he so desperately sought. The knight-errant took up his quest again with renewed vigor, but each time he pressed forward, he encountered some obstacle that needed more counsel to overcome. Three times the crone set some minor, but unwholesome price on her aid. Three times the paladin did as she bade him. At last, his impossible errand complete, Destran rode back to the land of Asarial.

Seven years to the day from the time he set forth, Destran again appeared before the elf-lord to demand his daughter’s hand. This time however, the paladin was a changed man. The hardships of his wanderings and the many battles he had fought had hardened him and brought a grim cast to his demeanor. Moreover, his moral compromises had separated him from communion with the god he served. So great, however, had Destran grown in puissance that he scarcely noticed, for it had been long since he had had need to call on his god for aid. Thus it was that when his paramour’s father again reneged and sought to assign him a third impossible task, Destran drew his sword that once he had sworn to the defense of right, swept the lord’s bodyguard away as a terrier scatters a pack of rats, and spitted the dissembling elf on four feet of mortal steel. Well might Destran have been damned had the matter ended there, but it did not. Enraged that his love had gone unrequited after all he had suffered to win it, the knight-errant dragged the weeping elf-maiden from the side of her slain father and forcibly claimed his rights of her.

Undoubtedly, it was the unconscionable perversion of his vow that doomed the knight’s soul. The elf-lord’s retainers regrouped and came against Destran in insurmountable numbers. The paladin fell, but he soon rose again as a vengeful undead, a Death Knight. Night after night, Destran's revenant sought to hack his way through the cordon of those who would keep from him from his promised bride. Each time he was slain at great cost of lives, but always he returned the next night. Those he slew stayed slain and the maid’s terror grew as the ranks of her protectors dwindled. Finally, trapped in her bedchamber in her father’s high tower with the armored tread of knight-revenant mounting the stairs outside, the elf-maid prevailed on the last of her dead father’s retainers to end her life before he threw his own upon the pyre of Destran’s embittered love.

Cheated of his prize, Destran set out again on a single-minded quest to win a daughter of the elves as his wife. Intelligent enough to realize the futility of attempts to woo a living elf in his present condition, the death knight sought out Cymmyrion when rumors reached him that a beautiful, undead elf-woman had taken authority as the Lady of Blackfane Spire. No faint-hearted ingenue, Tyriana seized the opportunity when Destran presented himself before her. With her fey wiles, the vampiress drew the death knight into her service. Although she does not believe it herself, Tyriana plays to Destran’s hopes that someday the still heart within her breast will turn his way and his vow may be fulfilled. In the meantime, she delights in playing the part of the cruel mistress, encouraging the knight's hopes and spurning him in turns. For his part, Destran serves his dark lady in perfect chastity, humility, and chivalry. It is even possible that this may, in some strange way unforeseen, lead to his redemption.
