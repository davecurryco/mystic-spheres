**Magic Resistance.** The iron hellhound has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Keen Hearing, Smell, and Taste.** The hound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. The hound can identify an individual creature by licking it and it never forgets a creature it has so identified.

**Spell Immunity.** The iron hellhound is immune to three spells chosen by its creator. Typical immunities include cone of cold, heat metal, and polymorph.

**Stunning Charge.** If the iron hellhound moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the end of the iron hellhound’s next turn.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The iron hellhound exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 30 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

An **Iron Hellhound** is created by a ritual akin to the one that creates a Helmed Horror, but which draws its power from the Infernal planes. Like a Helmed Horror, an Iron Hellhound is unswervingly loyal to its creator and follows the intent of its instructions, not just the exact wording. However, an Iron Hellhound’s more limited intelligence makes it significantly less capable of adapting to circumstances.
