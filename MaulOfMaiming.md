# Maul of Maiming

_Weapon (maul), very rare (requires attunement by a cleric of evil alignment)_

When you attack a creature with this weapon and hit, maximize your weapon damage against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on your attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 bludgeoning damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you crush one of the targetâ€™s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limbs to sever, you crush a portion of its body instead.
