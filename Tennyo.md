**Invisible Flight.** If she wills it, the tennyo is invisible while flying unless she attacks.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The tennyo’s innate spell casting ability is Charisma (Spell save DC 14). The tennyo can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:

At will: _detect evil and good, detect magic_  
3/day each: _beacon of hope, lesser restoration, prayer of healing, protection from evil and good, purify food and drink, sanctuary_  
1/day each: _dream, death ward_  

**Magic Resistance.** The tennyo has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unearthly Beauty.** If a male humanoid can see the tennyo, it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 16) whenever it targets the tennyo for an attack or attempts to cause a harmful area effect that would include the tennyo. On a failed save, the attacker must choose another target or arrange the area of effect to exclude the tennyo. If this is impossible, the would-be attacker is incapacitated until the start of his next turn.

## Actions

**Celestial Charm.** The tennyo targets one humanoid that she can see within 60 feet of her. If the target can see the tennyo, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. Males have disadvantage on this saving throw. The charmed creature regards the tennyo as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the tennyo’s control, it takes the tennyo’s requests of actions in the most favorable way it can.
Each time the tennyo or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the tennyo dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If the target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the tennyo’s Celestial Charm for the next 24 hours.
The tennyo can have no more than one humanoid charmed at a time.

## Legendary Actions

**Bestow a Boon.** Once per mission, as an action, a tennyo can innately cast an additional spell, which can only target another creature or group of creatures. The gods grant the tennyo a single additional spell drawn from the following list: Dispel Magic, Divination, Polymorph, Geas, Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds, Reincarnate, Heal, Regenerate, Foresight, True Resurrection, Wish. The spell is invariably related to the tennyo's mission and a tennyo unfailingly acts according to divine will in this.

**Tennyo** are spiritual beings who appear as women of sublime beauty. Their usual occupation is as courtesans to the gods, but they are sometimes sent to aid mortals or deliver messages. Their hair is done in elaborate, courtly styles and they wear exquisite jewelry. Heavenly Maidens are invariably dressed in flowing silk scarves and silk gowns of five colors. The gowns, _hagoromo_, enable them to fly between the mortal and celestial realms.

Tennyo are inherently incapable of violence. They accomplish their goals by means of their powers of persuasion and charm. If this does not serve, a tennyo will fail of her objective rather than harm even the lowliest or most vile of creatures.
