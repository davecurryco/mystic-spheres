**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (20-foot radius)  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small ball of sulphur and pitch)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  

An immobile vortex of heat and flame springs into existence in a 20-foot radius around you and remains for the duration. Any creature other than yourself that is within the vortex when it appears, moves into it for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn within it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7d8 fire and bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The vortex keeps fog, smoke and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward and flammable materials ignite. (Materials worn or carried by you are unaffected.) Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at you or targets behind the vortex are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giant or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through the vortex.

While surrounded by the vortex, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
