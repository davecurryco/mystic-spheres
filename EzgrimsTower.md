# Ezgrim's Tower

### Shrine
**Archdruid:** Elgrim the Forsaken (M, 1000+, Greed, Condescending, White-haired)  
Elgrim is ancient and withered. His unkempt white beard reaches to his knees and he keeps his long, snowy hair out of his eyes with a circlet of tarnished silver. In his youth, he was tempted away from his faith and became a figure in the rising cult of Abbathor. He repented and has sought to redeem himself in the solitary service of Zoldin, but he still struggles with greed.
