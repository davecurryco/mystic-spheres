## Areas

_Map:_ [Halls of Kazaz-druul Map](HallsOfKazaz-druulMap.pdf)

### A - Gates

Large bronze valves twisted off hinges. Water pours over the threshold and over the lip of the shelf before the gates, forming a waterfall that plummets 50' into a splash-pool beneath.

A heavy, rusted iron portcullis is dropped down at the north end of the hall. It is worked by a winch and capstain set in the west wall on the other side.

### B - Guard Hall

Door is iron and fitted to be barred from within. It is open and the hinges are rusted.

Kitchen: Rusty iron stove, rotted wooden preparation tables with rusty kitchen implements.

Bunk Room: Rotted remains of dwarf-sized bedsteads.

Duty office: Ruined writing desk (drawer: 2 rotted leather pouches with 80 gp, 70 pp; ruined iron pens and silver inkstand worth 2 gp)

Officer's quarters: Ruined bedstead and side-table. Rotted wooden chest with ruined clothes and Robe of Warmth.

Defense stair: Rusty iron stair winds counter-clockwise 50' up inside of tower with arrow-slits at itervals. Rusty iron swivel-mounts and brass couplings for flame and gas projectors are set into each embrasure.

### C - Armory 

Defense stair: Mirror image of the defense stair off the Guard Hall.

Arms room: Rusty and ruined chainmail, helmets, shields, and assorted weaponry in racks along walls. More racks hold brass flame and gas projector nozzles and arbelasts with rusty steel bows. Stacked wooden boxes hold iron-tipped arbelast bolts -- all ruined by age and damp. 

### D - Dungeon

Door is rusty iron with a grill at head-height (for a dwarf).

Guard Room:

Cells: Iron doors with grills. The skeleton of a prisoner lies amid a pile of debris on the floor just inside the door of the third cell. 

### E - Hall of Heroes

East Corridor: Six statues of dwarven soldiers carved of grey-green marble stand in niches along the corridor. Each commemorates an individual hero, whose name is carved in runes along the statue's base.

North Corridor: Six columns of grey-green marble support the arches of the ceiling. Each column commemorates a dwarven clan, whose name is carved in runes at the base of the column. The names of the ancestors of the clan are carved in orderly lines on the columns themselves.

Archway: Flanking the archway are two grey-green stelae carved with dwarven runes commemorating legendary dwarven kings and their ancestral lines.

### F - Gate Defense

Behind a porcullis at the south end of the hall are four huge, cylindrical brass tanks dulled with verdigris. These are fitted with couplings and connected by brass tubing. In the niches on either side of the hall are brass tables in which an array of levers fitted with crystal knobs are set.

### G - Great Hall

This hall was designed for defense against dragon invasion. Verdigrised ronze columns line each side of the hall. The geometric motifs on the columns hide long bronze blades which lie flat along the sides of the columns. The blades are hinged where they join the columns. When triggered, a system of weights and chains concealed beneath the floor causes the columns to spin. The blades are hinged where they join the columns. They fly out under centrifugal force and lock in place, forming a row of whirling death down both sides of the hall. This is the mechanical equivalent of a _blade barrier_ spell.

### H - Hydro Control

Central Chamber: Fountain with sunken bowl made of translucent, light blue stone shot through with veins of silver, along which dance glittering streaks of light.

North Chamber: Brass pillar decorated with geometric motifs and studded with white crystals.

South Chamber: Brass pillar decorated with geometric motifs and studded with red crystals.

Control Room: Dwarf-height desks of bronze fitted with arrays of levers with crystal knobs.

### I - Distribution Chamber

Niches contain huge wall-mounted cast brass spigots cast in the form of trout heads with gaping mouths. These are all pouring water. The water covers the central walkway to ankle depth.

4 feral water elementals will direct 5' wide jets of water to knock anyone in-line with the spouts into the water. Dex DC 17 -- success 9 (2d8) bludgeoning; fail half damage and pushed back 5 ft. The elementals will attack anyone who falls into the deep water, attempting to drown them.

At each end of the chamber, bronze ram's heads are mounted on the wall. These are activated by trigger-plates on the strongbox and the coffer (6d10 bludgeoning damage, Dex save DC 18 for half).  _Treasure:_ Iron strongboxes: Lvl 12 treasure hoard; Brass coffer: Keys to controls in Room H - Hydro Control.
