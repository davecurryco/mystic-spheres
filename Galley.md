A galley is a large vessel that can be used for trade, though most are intended strictly for war. Galleys are equipped with sails for cruising, but typically stow or lower their masts when going into battle or rowing into the wind, so as to be propelled primarily by oars. A (bireme) galley has two banks of oars staggered on either side of the vessel; the upper bank is situated above the lower to permit the oars of the upper bank to clear the oars of the rowers below.

Galleys are primarily used as naval marine vessels. Their main method of attack is ramming, often followed by boarding and melee combat. A typical galley mounts 2 ballistae in the bow. With little room for provisions, galleys put into shore every night, beaching stern first.
