## Actions

**Multiattack.** The unseen stalker makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the unseen guardian attaches to it. While attached, the unseen guardian can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The unseen guardian can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the unseen guardian by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.

An **Unseen Guardian** is an aberration summoned from the spaces between the stars to guard a location or a treasure of its summoner's choice for all of eternity, allowing no creature but its summoner to enter the area or access the item, unless the summoner instructed otherwise. If the item is stolen or destroyed, a summoned unseen guardian vanishes. It otherwise never abandons its post.
