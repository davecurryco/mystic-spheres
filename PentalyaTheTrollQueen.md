**Keen Smell.** The hag has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The hag's innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +8 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _chill touch, detect magic, eldritch blast, poison spray_  
3/day each: _misty step, plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep_  
2/day each: _counterspell, dispel magic_  
1/day each: _banishment, scrying_

**Magic Resistance.** The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** The hag regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn. If the hag takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the hag's next turn. The hag dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Unwholesome Aura.** At the start of each of the hag's turns, each creature within 5 feet of her takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. A creature that touches the hag or hits her with a melee attach while within 5 feet of her takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

### Codex of Narastur

**Mark of Darkness.** Pentalya has advantage on Charisma(Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma(Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.

**Incite Evil.** While holding the Codex, 2 times per day Pentalya can use an action to cast _mass suggestion_ (save DC 18). Evil-aligned creatures targeted by this spell have disadvantage on the saving throw. The spell's duration is 24 hours for good-aligned creatures, 10 days for neutral-aligned creatures, and 30 days for evil-aligned creatures.

**Blasphemous Utterance.** While holding the Codex, 2 times per day Pentalya can use an action to recite a passage that blasts the sanity of those who hear it. Each non-evil creature within 30 feet of you that can hear her takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. In addition, good-aligned creatures must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of Pentalya's next turn.

### Necklace of Autumn

**Chill Rebuke.** When a creature hits Pentalya with a melee weapon or spell attack, she can use her reaction to deal 3d6 cold damage to that creature.

**Autumn Blast.** When a creature targets Pentalya with a ranged weapon or spell attack, she can use her reaction to give the creature disadvantage on the attack.

**Swept Away.** Pentalya can use her movement to fly up to 80 feet in a single direction. She may change altitude, but if she does not land by the end of the movement, she falls (see _Falling Leaves_).

**Falling Leaves.** When Pentalya falls while wearing the necklace, she descends 60 feet per round and takes no damage from falling.

**Master of Autumn.** Pentalya can use the necklace to cast the _control weather_ spell. Once she has used this property, it can't be used again for 7 days.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hag makes three attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws. Only one of the claw attacks can use _curse of the disfiguring strike_.

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (2d8 + 9) slashing damage.

**Curse of the Disfiguring Strike.** When the hag hits a creature with a claw attack, as a bonus action, the hag can magically force the creature to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed with magical deformities in addition to the damage it suffers from the hit. While deformed, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks based on Charisma.
The deformities the hag inflicts in this way are permanent unless cured by a _greater restoration_ or similar magic.

**Change Shape.** The hag magically polymorphs into a Medium female humanoid or a Large female giant, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

**Etherealness.** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hate must have a _heartstone_ in her possession.

**Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A _protection from evil and good_ spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a _magic circle_. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's _soul bag_. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the _greater restoration_ spell or similar magic.

## Legendary Actions

Pentalya can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Pentalya regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn. The effects of a legendary action last for the full duration without requiring concentration.

**Command.** Pentalya casts the _command_ spell targeting a single creature. Evil creatures have disadvantage on their saving throws against this spell so long as the command is not immediately harmful to the target creature personally.

**Sign of Ill Omen (Costs 2 Actions).** Pentalya places a curse on a creature she can see within range and chooses one of the creature's abilities. Until the end of the target's next turn, it has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability. If an affected target rolls a Critical Failure on an ability check, saving throw, or attack, it suffers disadvantage on the results check.

**Sign of Bewilderment (Costs 3 Actions).** Pentalya casts a veil of confusion over a creature she can see within range. The target must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw, unless Pentalya is incapacitated. On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action, but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature takes no action or movement, but falls prone and babbles inccoherently.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Pentalya can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects: the hag can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* Magical darkness spreads from a point the hag chooses within 60 feet of her, filling a 15-foot radius sphere until the hag dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with dark vision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
* A magical witch-light appears at a point the hag chooses within 60 feet of her. The witch-light resembles a will-o'-wisp, and has a fly speed of 50 ft. (hover), but is entirely incoporeal and cannot attack. It sheds bright light in a 5 to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The hag can alter the radius as a bonus action. Within its radius, the light reveals hidden, invisible, or ethereal creatures or objects and shows the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. The hag can command the witch-light to stay in place, to move in a given direction, or to follow a selected creature at a given distance. The witch light lasts until the hag dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies.

**Pentalya the Troll Queen** Pentalya is a member of the Coven of Seven Sisters. Her pact was originally with Gothrog the Tyrant, the cruel overlord of Cymmyrion, but she sought even more powerful magic. Her quest for forbidden lore led her to explore ancient barrows and contact unwholesome beings from beyond the mortal world. This led directly to a misadventure in which a curse transformed Pentalya into a troll, although she retained her hag abilities. Rather pleased with the effect, she made it her schtick. She bullied her way to headship of the bands of trolls and ogres who inhabit the Trollfells. Styling herself, "The Troll Queen", Pentayla set up her headquarters at a ruined Azruun fortress and began plotting to be a Power.
