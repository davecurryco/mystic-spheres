On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the archmage takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the archmage can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The main entry to the archmage's lair becomes the entry to a _mordenkainen's magnificent mansion_.  
- While inside the extradimensional space of the mansion, one creature the archmage can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be expelled from the extra dimensional space into the open spaces nearest the entrance.

**Jaman Khal** is not really an individual, but rather is a line of wizards who have passed down this identity from master to apprentice. Along with certain powers and prerogatives handed down from the original Jaman Khal, the identity also comes with a geas. The wizard who bears the name can never spend the night in the same place any time in the same moon and must take a new wife each year. Else, a nameless doom will overtake him. Xenadria, the witch who so cursed the original Jaman, still lives as a **greater lamia**, endlessly pursuing those of his line to bring about his destruction.

The current Jaman was born Kon Lauju in Saojung, the son of a prosperous Juchin sea-merchant. He is in early middle age and is gaunt, but in public he uses _change shape_ to assume the traditional Jaman Khal appearance, that of a heavyset man in his mid fifties with grey-streaked hair pulled into a topknot, long mustachios, and eyes the color of green jade. Jaman lives a sybaritic lifestyle, but is prone to ennui as a result.
