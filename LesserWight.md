## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wight makes two spear attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one spear attack.

**Life Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Spear.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20 ft./60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Lesser Wights** are usually victims of a more powerful wight, such as an elven wight. Such wights are under the control of their creator, but can become free-willed if their creator dies. Certain conditions, such as areas steeped in ambient necrotic energy, can cause free-willed lesser wights to rise spontaneously.
