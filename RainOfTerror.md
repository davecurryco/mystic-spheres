A threatening, black, storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Beneath the cloud, driving rain falls while thunder and lightning rage overhead. The area beneath the cloud becomes obscured. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears or at the start of its turn must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened until the end of its next turn. In addition to the usual effects of the frightened condition, frightened creatures must use their movement each round to seek shelter from the storm or escape from its area of effect by the shortest route, whichever seems most expedient. If the shelter or route of escape is obviously dangerous, such as the lair of a cave bear or a precipice, the frightened creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to avoid fleeing that way.
