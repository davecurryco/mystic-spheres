# Tolengul

_Map:_ [Tolengul Map](TolengulMap.pdf)

Tolengul is the former capital and last refuge of the Xochuaco civilization. It lies on Lake Tepeco at the confluence of the Huantalte and Tumba rivers.

Only the Xochuaco elites and their Quetalpa slaves are allowed into the walled city. Outside the walls and over the bridges, Quetalpa freeman merchants, tradesmen, and untouchables provide for the city's material needs. A Xochuaco military order based in the citadel that sits atop a bluff south of the lake defends the city, mostly from the threat of Quetalpa uprising. In the shadow of the citidel lies a seedy warehouse district that was once the city's main financial center when trade flowed along the rivers between the mountains and the coast.

Outside the gate Quetalpa freemen have built wattle-and-daub dwellings and animal pens. There are also a few large communal houses used by the traveling merchants.

In this section of the city, limestone buildings predominate. Many of them are centuries old and almost all are meticulously maintained by slaves.

### E) Pleasure Palace

Emperor Teuchuatzin maintains a luxurous palace at the edge of an artificial pond surrounded by lush gardens and outbuildings for his many servitors, guards, and slaves.

Temples and shrines to the city's myriad gods are jammed together in this district. The architecture and construction of these buildings varies greatly according to the power and status of the gods and their worshipers.

Many of the Xochuaco gods are related to one another in sometimes mysterious and counter-intuitive ways. For example, Matlacapo (NG Goddess of New Corn), Malancuelhe (LE Goddess of Jealousy), and Morrighu (N Goddess of Death), are often worshipped together as a divine triad.
