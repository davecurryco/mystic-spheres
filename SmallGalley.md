A small galley is typically used for warfare, although they are popular as smuggling vessels as well. Like other galleys, they are equipped with sails for cruising, but typically stow or lower their masts when going into battle or rowing into the wind, so as to be propelled primarily by oars. A (bireme) small galley has two banks of oars. The rowers sit on the topdeck, protected by an oarbox that runs along the sides of the ship. The upper oar rests on an outrigger located in the oarbox, the lower oar rests on the topwale. 

A small galley's usual mode of attack is to ram and board its target. Small gallies are even less seaworthy than their larger cousins and so put into shore every night, beaching stern first.
