# Essealona

The Kingdom of Essealona is the mother country of the Telenar. In addition, Essealona claims the lands of Rhunnur, Palanor, and Rothannur as its domain.

Essealona has been ruled by titular monarchs descending in three lines since it was founded almost fifteen-hundred years ago by human who fled in ships from a doomed continent far over the sea to the west. The current monarch, Allenar III, was deposed by an usurper, Caladron the Despised, shortly after his reign began. Although Caladron was himself dethroned after only a few months, the king could not be found, so a regent, Areglen son of Arlethor reigns in his place.
