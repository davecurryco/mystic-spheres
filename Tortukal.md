# Tortukal

_Map:_ [Tortukal Map](TortukalMap.pdf)

Tortukal is a raucous town serving pirates and smugglers who sail the Kheraz Coast. It is built at the head of a sheltered harbor on the ruins of an ancient walled city. Tortukal is bordered on two sides by jungle and on one side by swamp. It is, for practical purposes, only accessible by the harbor. 

The jungle that surrounds the town on three sides teems with native Quetalpa tribesmen. There are surprisingly few Quetalpa among the town's population, but there are many Khemez, Juchen, and even Ahlrain residents. Ahlrain and Kwanshali are commonly found in the crews of pirate and smuggler ships and Aili are not infrequently among them. Freed slaves, mostly Kwanshali and Khemez, perform most of the laborious tasks.

**Settlement Name:** Tortukal
**Population:**	4,778
**Size** The town of Tortukal covers an area of approximately 179 acres, with a total population of 4778 people.

## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Democracy

The town of Tortukal is governed by a form of democracy established in the Article of the Town. An Assembly meets once a week at the Great Hall. The electors to the Assembly are divided into three bodies: Captains, Merchants, and Tradesmen -- each with its own criteria for membership. At high noon on Assembly Day, the attendees from each body are counted. The number of delegates to that day's Assembly is fixed at one quarter of the attendance of the smallest representation among the three bodies. Delegates to each body are chosen by lot. A Speaker for the Assembly is elected by the body that had the highest attendance. Everyone else is sent away and the Speaker convenes the Assembly. Matters great and small, except for changes to the town's Articles, are decided by a simple majority vote of the delegates. Delegates are sequestered and are compensated with 2 GP a day from the public treasury and free drinks from all the local taverns once the proceedings conclude.  

Once a year, on New Year's Day, the Assembly entertains motions to change the town's charter, which require a two-thirds majority to carry. These seldom pass, but the raucous debate usually leads to an all-night drinking-binge as the points are hashed and rehashed over mugs of ale and bottles of rum.

A notable feature of the town's Articles is the "free shore" law. It essentially holds that any slave that sets foot on the shore of the town becomes free. The law is overwhelmingly supported by the Tradesmen, particularly the longshoremen, who understand that competition from slaves would decrease the value of their labor. It is overwhelmingly opposed by the Merchants, who would very much like to decrease the value of labor. The Captains are split more or less evenly between those who would like to be see a slave-market in Tortukal, and those who believe that slavery is antithetical to the freedom that is the essential nature of a pirate's life. There are former slaves in each camp -- some who are adamantly opposed to slavery and others who believe that slavery is the natural order of things (so why not profit from it).  

It is the duty of the harbor pilots to read the Articles to an all-hands assembly of the crew of each ship before they guide it into the harbor. Beside the provisions for the Assembly and "free shore" law, the Articles basically espouse an extreme form of Libertarian philosophy -- you are free to do what you want, but if somebody else objects to it, they have the right to retaliate within limits set by the Articles. For example, a merchant is within his rights to have his guards whip, mutilate, or even kill someone who steals from him. By the same token, a ship's captain is within his rights to have his crew do the same to a merchant who cheats him. As might be expected, this arrangement leads to frequent flare-ups of violence and ruthless oppression of the weak. However, the Racketeer's Syndicate serves as an unofficial police force though various protection rackets.

The town finances its operations by means of a harbor tax: 1 GP per ton of cargo capacity -- whether the ship is carrying any cargo or not. The harbor pilots assess and levy this tax.

## Professions

The town has 17 households of powerful fences, pirates, and smugglers. The town is patrolled by 24 guardsmen, and there are 5 advocates to assist with legal matters. There are 33 clergymen and 3 priests.

## Districts

Tortukal is a town mostly of ramshackle buildings and thatched huts sprung up like weeds between the massive but crumbled works of a city that had long been abandoned before the rise of the Azruun Empire. The jungle grows right up to the outer walls, which were built of cut limestone filled with rubble. Even in their decay, the vine-grown towers, platforms, and foundations of the ancient city stand in sharp contrast to the newer structures in their height and solidity. Only the mansions, offices, and strongholds of the town's power brokers are well-built and in good repair.

### A) The Beacon Towers

The ruins of a pair of large, round towers stand on a ridge overlooking the north end of the harbor. Although their materials are similar to those of the walls and towers of the ancient city, their architecture and construction is quite different. But in any event, only the foundations and rings of broken stones remain.

A new beacon-hut 20 feet high has been built from reclaimed limestone blocks on the foundation of the southernmost tower. It too is round, but it is much narrower than the original tower. A watchman is on duty at all times, ready to fire a wood pyre atop the hut in the event of an attack or other emergency. A ship's bell is mounted on an iron scaffold near the hut. It and a flag-mast close by are used to give notice of the approach of vessels by way of the harbor.

### B) The Bilge (Slum)

**Brothel:** The Copper Nail (Atrocious), Proprietor: Nyamau M'okom (F, 31, Kwanshali, commoner, CG, Fear, Matter-of-Fact, Rounded)  
_Nyamau was one of the wives of a tribal king who was deposed by a rival. She fled from the slaughter, but was taken by slavers and forced into prostitution in Ashakala. She was passed from one owner to another and finally ended up in Tortukal. Freed, but no longer under protection, Nyamau herself became the pander for the brothel, which she renamed after a protective superstition of her tribe. The house has not prospered and now rents a rundown, vermin-infested hut in the Bilge. Nyamau still lives in fear that the king who deposed her late husband will track her down. Like most of her slovenly trulls, she is addicted to opium. This, with worry and harship, have etched lines in her face, although she retains the plumpness that once marked her as an aristocrat among her tribe. Nyamau accepts all of this with a resigned fatalism._

**Inn:** The Spear of Vihyndra Inn (Poor), Proprietor: Bisha Babhrava (F, 20, Khemez, commoner, CE, Money, Malicious, Buxom)  
_Bisha saved her earnings from prostitution to buy this inn in the poorest part of town. She barely makes expenses and she will do pretty much anything for cash. Although she is young and is endowed with the lush figure renowned among Khemez women, Bisha's venomous tongue and spitefulness have given her a reputation as a wench to steer cleer of._

**Tavern:** Pavillion of the Monkey King (Poor), Proprietor: Asajan Puraprana (M, 49, Khemez, guard, CN, Experimentation, Bitter, Sweaty)  
_Since his days as a guardsman in Khanashar, Asajan has run many businesses, all of which have failed -- mostly due to his constant tinkering. He came to Tortukal fleeing his creditors and took proprietership of the Pavillion from his uncle, who was in ill-health and wanted to retire. Asajan was almost immediately swindled in a deal that cost him the contolling interest in the tavern. He now runs the place for his partner, but his resentement is as plain to see as the perspiration that constantly beads his forehead._

**Tavern:** The Viridian Chalice (Poor), Proprietor: Buddhadka Bhaydeep (M, 32, Khemez, commoner, CG, Amusement, Matter-of-Fact, Bulging)  
_Buddhaka is a happy-go-lucky fat man who doesn't look much beyond the pleasures of food, wine, and dancing-girls. He is the very personification of Khemez fatalism._

**Opium Den:** The Red Ember (Poor), Proprietor: Wei Yun-Gao (M, 43, Juchen, thug, NE, Experimentation, Malicious, Average)  
_Yun-Gao has the sort of unexceptional look that you could pass on the street and never notice. This has served him well in his career as a petty tough and drug dealer. He always has some new hustle going, but whatever he has a hand in is guaranteed to be hurtful to someone._

**Opium Den:** The Inner Eye (Atrocious), Proprietor: Suti Mahamakati (F, 31, Khemez, thug, CN, Revenge, Offensive, Plain)  
_Too homely to be marriageable or even to be successful as a prostitute in a sailor town, Suti drifted into the drug trade. She has an obnoxious personality and runs the most squalid of the town's drug houses._

**Drum Maker:** Kenga the Beater (Poor), Proprietor: Kenga Agamama (M, 23, Kwanshali, ruffian, CN, Boredom, Critical, Brunette)  
_Kenga carves large drums of the kind used aboard galleys and sells them from his shack, which is on the main street on the way to the North Gate. His workmanship is only fair because this is a side-business from his main occupation, which is as the leader of a press-gang for hire. Kenga doesn't keep to anything long. His hair is bleached after the manner of some of the jungle tribes._

**Leatherworker:** Mungo's Bags (Medium), Proprietor: Mungo (M, 26, Kwanshali, brigand, N, Friendship, Condescending, Dainty)  
_Mungo is a slightly-built man who, fortunately, is well known and liked in the Bilge. Although he was born to a jungle tribe, he grew up as a household slave to a noble house in Neunazar. He was later captured and sold as a slave to a nomad tent-maker, for whom he toiled until he ran away to join first a bandit gang and then a pirate crew. He was educated along with his master's children and, although he speaks no Kwanshali, he can speak Pashani as well as the tongue of the Juchen nomads. He believes that this sets him above most other residents of The Bilge and he tends to talk down to people who are from more rustic backgrounds._

**Rum Maker:** Chisa's Grog Shop (Atrocious), Proprietor: Chisa (M, 27, Kwanshali, bard, LN, Fear, Confused, Upright)  
_Chisa was trained as a loresinger of his tribe. A born coward, he was cursed by the tribe's shaman to the effect that he runs the risk of attack by a phantasmal killer any time he uses his bardic abilities. In an attempt to escape this hex, he fled downriver to Ashakala, where joined a slaver crew and eventually ended up in Tortuakal. With his modest share of the profits of his first voyage, he set up a rum distillery. However, the local sugarcane is rather poor and Chisa's understanding of the process is even poorer. He has resorted to selling a diluted, adulterated and sub-standard rum known as grog._

### C) Temple Square

Three stepped pyramids of weathered stone with a paved courtyard between them frame several more recent shrines built with salvaged stone and rough timbers. These are staffed by what passes for clergy in this outpost.

**Shrine:** The Temple of the Hand of Doom - Kushyth (Poor), Priest: Ukugh Dorghu (M, 69, Juchen, priest, NE, Power, Haughty, Shaggy)  
_The worship of the god Kushyth, which was widespread in the days of the Azruun Empire, still persists among some of the Juchen nomad tribes. Ukugh came to Tortukal to build a power base for his god. He is an old man, but he is quite energetic. His fanatic gaze and unkempt white hair and beard give him the dangerous look of the wildest of nomad bandits. Despite his poor estate in Tortukal, Ukugh carries himself with an air of superiority, especially in his dealings with his minions and sycophants._

**Shrine:** The Grotto of Our Lady of the Deeps - Yshma (Good), Priest: Che Shiouli (F, 32, Juchen, priest, CN, Revenge, Reverant, Frail)  
_Shiouli was the abbess of a nunnery near Jeosong. She was captured and enslaved by Ahlrain pirates and suffered cruelly at their hands until their galley was driven by a freak storm to seek shelter in Tortukal's harbor. Emancipated by virtue of the "free shores" law, Shiouli came to understand that the goddess Yshma meant for her to come here. However, her ordeal shattered her health and the goddess has not seen fit to restore it. To all appearances, Shiouli leads a devout life of peace, but as with the sea, calm waters can conceal deadly deeps. The priestess bears a mortal grudge against Ahlraini pirates. Posing as a prostitute in one or another of Tortukal's many brothels, she secretly arranges for the assassination of any such as come into port._

**Shrine:** The Altar of the Lord of Storms - Tamirz (Poor), Priest: Dana Guradani (M, 30, Khemez, priest, N, Survival, Reflective, Spirited)  
_Dana once sailed with a pirate galley until a falling-out with other members of his crew led to his being marooned on an island. Rescued by circumstances that he interpreted as a miracle of Tamirz, Dana was brought to Tortukal, where he has been gifted with priestly powers and a divine mission._

### D) The Lee Ward (Businesses and Inns)

**Inn:** Vihyndra's Lightning Inn (Good), Proprietor: Dyoti Dhavarati (F, 38, Khemez, commoner, LE, Friendship, Brave, Olive)  
_Dyoti was brought to Tortukal from Khanengul as a prostitute when she was in her early twenties. Her complexion is lighter than usual for a Khemez and in her day, she was considered a beauty. She had the good looks and good fortune to attract a high-ranking racketeer and she had the good sense to have him set her up in business before he came to the inevitable bad end. She also has a good disposition and no small amount of pluck, which has won her enough friends to sustain her business._

**Inn:** A Thief's Luck Inn (Medium), Proprietor: Aranan Drupchandra (M, 16, Khemez, commoner, LN, Recognition, Matter-of-Fact, Ugly)  
_Aranan inherited this inn from his uncle, who was an adventuring rogue. His uncle's friends, who are medium-level adventurers, made enough of an impression on the locals that no one has been willing to risk messing with the boy in the few months since he came into his inheritance. Aranan is ill-favored, but smart enough. He was apprenticed to his uncle for long enough to know how to manage the inn and he dreams of making it, and himself, famous._

**Religious Items:** Mufta Ali (Excellent), Proprietor: Mufta Ali (M, 23, Ahlrain, warlock of the fiend, NE, Survival, Solemn, Ugly)  
_Mufta was the apprentice of a hedge wizard in Pashan until a pact with a prince of the infernal regions set him on a quest to recover a lost artifact. He came to Tortukal and set himself up as a black-market dealer in religious items as a cover for his search. He has a limited time to accomplish his goal or his very soul will be forfeit. As a result, he allows himself no distractions and has adopted a grim demeanor. This is heightened by the horrific scars that disfigure the left side of his face -- a token of his unholy pact._

**Armorer:** Armor of the Divine Sea (Excellent), Proprietor: Jia Su-Hao (M, 33, Juchen, veteran, LG, Loyalty, Informed, Hunched)  
_Su-Hao crafts excellent medium and heavy armor and shields. He also buys and sells used armor, shields, and weapons, including magic varieties. He was a servitor of a deposed duke of Saojung and joined his master in exile, a road that eventually led to Tortukal. Su-Hao has picked up something of a stoop from working long hours over his forge and workbench. He is an influential member of the Tradesman's Guild and is aware of much of what goes on in the town._

**Shipwright:** Janata's Shipbuilders (Good), Proprietor: Janata Apipani (M, 57, Khemez, ship captain, LN, Loyalty, Sincere, Blue-Eyed)  
_Janata's blue eyes proclaim him to be of mixed race and his bearing just as surely proclaims him a master sailor. If he has settled down to build ships, he is no less a captain of men. The workers in his shipyard are his crew now and the Tradesman's Guild is the fleet for which he sails. He is bluff, but he always means what he says and says what he means._

**Animals (Mounts and Pets):** Avikan's Beasts (Excellent), Proprietor: Avikan Kandir (M, 23, Khemez, commoner, NG, Romance, Sincere, Spirited)  
_Avikan was raised in a Khanashar circus family, the son of an elephant trainer. In Saojung, he was pressed into service aboard a merchant vessel and forcibly enlisted into the crew of a pirate that took her. By great good fortune, he arrived in Tortukal in one piece and has been waiting for an opportunity to ship out aboard a vessel with a trustworthy captain and crew. Needless to say, his wait has been long. In the meantime, has made the best of his situation. He trades with the Quetalpa natives, who capture exotic birds and animals, which he trains and sells. He also deals in animals of more mundane sorts, and keeps a stable of donkeys, which he rents by the day._

### E) The North Ward (Brothels and Taverns)

**Brothel:** The Maiden's Hut (Medium), Proprietor: Anot Na'Sekki (F, 25, Kwanshali, commoner, N, Self-improvement, Offensive, Shaggy)  
_Anot was a prostitute who overcame her circumstances to be the owner of a brothel herself. Her curly black hair is a wild mop, but she is attractive enough. Unfortunately, she is wont to deliver a withering stream of profanity-laced invective at anyone who merely looks at her the wrong way. Nevertheless, she has ambitions to expand her business and take it uptown._

**Brothel:** The Devi's Welcome (Medium), Proprietor: Atsanar Bhululata (M, 20, Khemez, thug, LE, Loyalty, Haughty, Manly)  
_Atsanar is brawny and strong and wears a thick, curly beard that belies his young age. A short stint as a deck-rat landed him here in Tortukal, where a few years as an goon for the Racketeers set him up to be a pimp. He still has ties to Gannara Bhishuvana, and is (dangerously) cocky in the belief that his "connections" make him "bolt-proof"._ 

**Brothel:** The House of Delightful Follies (Medium), Proprietor: Baladha Havaswani (M, 31, Khemez, veteran, CE, Curiosity, Informed, Freckled)  
_Baladha is very recognizable, being unusually light-skinned with a heavily-freckled face. He was once an officer of the Imperial Army in Khanashar, but was disgraced, stripped of his rank, and exiled. He spent several years in the city-states of Pashan, first as a brigand and then as a mercenary, before he took to the seas as a marine sergeant on a pirate vessel. After a particularly profitable, but bruising, cruise, Baladha decided to settle down. He enjoys his life these days, being amply supplied for all his wants, but a restlessness is growing in him again. He keeps up with the current happenings in town, only half-aware that he is looking for some new adventure._

**Brothel:** The Crossed Palms (Good), Proprietor: Tumaha Akono (M, 31, Aili, thug, LE, Money, Fanciful, Rosy)  
_Tuhama is another ex-pirate turned pander. His girls are all Aili. He claims that they are his wives and that he allows his "guests" to sleep with them as an act of hospitality. The part about being married to the women may actually be true and Tuhama is assuredly something of a romantic, but he runs his operation with a sharp eye to profit. Woe to the "guest" who doesn't properly express his appreciation with suitable "gifts"._

**Tavern:** Thirst of the Hydra (Atrocious), Proprietor: Pana Jityahani (F, 22, Khemez, commoner, NG, Greed, Confused, Scarred)  
_Pana is the wife of a pirate captain, although she is such a harridan that he seldom stays long in port. The Thirst is hers to run and she is slowly ruining her business with short-sighted penny-pinching. Her fondness for strong drink leaves her a bit addled at the best of times, which doesn't help things either. She was once convicted of theft in Khanashar and wears the brand of punishment on her face._

**Tavern:** The Jade Flagon (Poor), Proprietor: Fumisho Hima (F, 36, Daimojin, martial arts adept, LN, Honor, Reflective, Buxom)  
_Hima runs the Flagon as a "floating house" where guests can rent rooms to be plied with drink and entertained by female performers. Needless to say, most of the North Ward's visitors prefer less refined fare and the Flagon isn't very popular, but this suits Hima just fine since the tavern is only a cover for her occupation as a spy for Shoda Hideosu. Hima insists that her "dancing-girls" are not prostitutes and she is not a pander. More than one unruly sailor has woken up in the gutter with a dislocated arm or two after failing to observe the distinction. Hima has other secrets as well -- concealed by the constrictive silk robes she favors._

**Tavern:** The Black Spear (Good), Proprietor: Kahlan Mabhabra (M, 23, Kwanshali, spy, CN, Friendship, Matter-of-Fact, Wild)  
_Kahlan is a tall, strong man who bears the ritual scarification and piercings of a warrior of the Kalakiri valley tribes. Despite appearances, he is down-to-earth and friendly. However, he has ulterior motives for his naturally outgoing nature. He is a spy in the employ of Xiu Chui-Jiao._

**Opium Den:** Dreams of Bliss (Good), Proprietor: Amarit Vijrapada (M, 20, Khemez, commoner, N, Destiny, Cheerful, Towering)  
_Amarit is a young man, but he is a great believer in Morrighu, the goddess of Fate. He argues that fate is predestined and unalterable so why strive and why worry? He guiltlessly caters to his patrons and accepts their eventual ruin with equanimity. Atypically for a Khemez, Amarit is very tall._

**Opium Den:** Breath of the Lotus (Good), Proprietor: Ang Jucheo (F, 37, Juchen, enchanter, LN, Boredom, Fanciful, Pretty)  
_Jucheo is attractive even at her age, but she has never been married because only her arcane studies really interest her. She runs the opium den as a front for her research into the mystic techniques of mind control. She tells herself that she will find a husband once she unlocks and controls the mysterious power that enables women to so completely enamour and enthrall men._

### F) The North Docks (Warehouses and Wharves)

A sign at the head of each dock reads, "Welcome to Tortukal. You have just found a more wretched hive of scum and villany."

Berths at the North Docks are charged at a daily or monthly rate by the size of the ship. The cost includes protection payments to the Racketeers:

|   Size     | Daily | Monthly |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- |
| Large      |  3 sp |    6 gp |
| Huge       |  5 sp |   11 gp |
| Colossal   |  1 gp |   22 gp |
| Gargantuan |  3 gp |   65 gp |

**Ship:** The Cloud of Vengance (Pirate Galley, Excellent), Captain: Saleet Mahrana (F, 33, Khemez, bandit captain, CN, Revenge, Solemn, Gaunt)  
_Saleet is from a mountain-bandit tribe of Khanashar and she has the tough, wiry look and grim manner of her people. She does not revel in battle or slaughter, but she kills without compunction or remorse when she has to. Her hatred is reserved for the Emperor of Khanashar and his armies, who annihilated her clan. Saleet keeps the Cloud in top fighting shape so that she can take on Imperial warships when the occasion arises._

_Ship's Mage:_ Abhabhin Vipatra (M, 45, Khemez, archmage, LE, Honor, Bitter, Handsome)   
_Abhabhin was until recently a court magician proudly in the service of Shan Timuraz the Glorious. Unfortunately, he made enemies of a powerful merchant, a member of the Amel Merjan, who successfully intrigued to have Abhabhin dishonored and banished from court. Enraged and embittered, Abhabhin partnered with Saleet to revenge himself on the empire, and especially on its merchants._

**Ship:** The Twilight Rendevous (Smuggler Sailing Ship, Poor), Captain: Bokalee Ngulu (M, 26, Kwanshali, bandit captain, CN, Power, Malicious, Clean)  
_Bokalee is a large, powerful man and every inch of him radiates menace. Before he took to the sea, he was head of a slaver gang that ferried captives down the Kalakiri River to the markets in Ashakala. Now, he runs human cargo from Ashakala to Masheer, carrying tea and weapons on the return trip. For all the corruption of his heart, Bokalee is fastidious about his personal appearance, as he feels that good grooming distinguishes a civilized man such as himself from the savages he delivers into bondage. The Rendevous is currently bound for Ashakala and Bokalee has stopped in Tortukal to refit, since his ship is in bad shape from the effects of a storm._

**Ship:** The Saffron Dragon (Pirate Sailing Ship, Poor), Captain: Kwan Tanlon (M, 31, Juchen, bandit captain, CN, Destiny, Confused, Homely)  
_Tanlon was leader of a band of highway robbers who preyed on merchants along the road from Khanengul to Saojung. When the authorities turned up the heat, he escaped to the sea. More through survivorship than seamanship, he became the captain of the Dragon. He was born under auspicious omens and believes that he is marked for a special destiny. This gives him confidence and an air of command, but he is a hopeless lubber. His crew respect him for his courage in battle and his useful connections for the ransom of hostages, but they have learned to ignore his inept attempts to manage the ship. Tanlon is stocky and coarse-featured -- every bit as hapless at romance as he is at sailing._

### G) Assembly Square

### H) Scrivener's Row

### I) Crossroads (Businesses and Boarding Houses)

**Boarding House:** Amanant's Lodging Rooms (Poor), Proprietor: Amanant Arayati (M, 59, Khemez, priest, LN, Honor, Haughty, Barrel-Chested)  
_Amanant is a priest of Gilgesh, the god of law and justice. He came here to further this cause, but his message has been ill-received. He runs the boarding house to support himself and his few acolytes and only sets up a tent as a shrine on market days. Despite his rather poor estate, he is convinced of the rightness of his cause and despite his advanced years, he is still burly and strong and has been known to knock a few heads together when necessary._

**Boarding House:** Jurgai's Flophouse (Atrocious), Proprietor: Jurgai Gendran (M, 47, Juchen, commoner, CG, Revenge, Cowardly, Shaggy)  
_Jurgai was a deserter from the Imperial Army of Khanashar who fled to the northeast provinces and worked as a miner. Threatened with discovery, he fled again to Masheer and took to sea. After a short stint as a pirate, which was even less to his liking than being a soldier, he found his way to Tortukal, where he bought an old warehouse and converted it to this deplorable boarding-house. Jurgai still sports the unkempt appearance of a nomad. He is consumed with hatred for the Empire of Khanashar, but can vent this only in petty, secret acts of spite against Juchen from Khanengul and its surrounding provinces._

**Brewer:** Seafoam Brewery (Medium), Proprietor: Muhtaa Ameed (M, 35, Ahlrain, guard, LN, Honor, Bitter, Average)  
_Muhtaa was a member of the city guard of Nashal before the revolution cast him adrift. He enlisted as a marine aboard a privateer galley, but his captain turned pirate at the first opportunity. An outlaw by no choice of his own, Muhtaa turned to an honest trade in Tortukal having learned the craft from his father, but he harbors a grudge against pirates in general and his former captain in particular._

**Weapons:** The Shark's Teeth (Medium), Proprietor: Opuaa Kalikai (M, 27, Aili, tribal warrior, LN, Fear, Sarcastic, Smelly)  
_Opuaa was a thief who ran away to escape justice and joined the Aili pirates. His cowardice earned him the contempt of his shipmates, who marooned him. He was rescued by a stroke of good fortune and brought to Tortukal, but dared not risk putting to sea again. He learned the martial dances of his people and has adapted them to other bladed weapons. He makes great show of this talent to display his wares, but he has no particular skill as a warrior. Opuaa is sharp-tongued and his habit of wearing a charm of smelly herbs as proof against tropical disease makes him as offensive to the nose as he is to the ear._

### J) The South Docks (Warehouses and Wharves)

The South Docks and their adjoining warehouses have better security and more amenities. The ships that dock here typically carry more high-value cargo. 

Berths at the South Docks are charged at a daily or monthly rate by the size of the ship. The cost includes protection payments to the Racketeers:

|   Size     | Daily | Monthly |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- |
| Large      |  5 sp |   11 gp |
| Huge       |  7 sp |   15 gp |
| Colossal   |  2 gp |   40 gp |
| Gargantuan |  5 gp |  112 gp |

**Ship:** The Tides of Chaos (Smuggler Small Galley, Medium), Captain: Diwe Oyambala (F, 31, Kwanshali, pirate captain, CN, Curiosity, Cheerful, Plain)  
_Diwe is a happy-go-lucky and impetuous woman. With her lean figure and homely features and dressed in sailor's pantaloons, Diwe can easily be mistaken for a man. She loves exploring and few captains can match her knowledge of the coast. Because of this, Diwe has been more successful as a smuggler than as a pirate. Her crew is just as happy for this since the Tides is a rather small ship._

**Ship:** The Marid's Fury (Pirate Galley, Good), Captain: Badri bal-Kharjii (M, 26, Ahlrain, pirate captain, NE, Glory, Condescending, Ungainly)  
_Badri was a privateer with letters of the marque from the King Gethzir of Neunazar. These were invalidated when the city-state fell to the Ramad Lethshanar, but Badri never even slowed down. Indeed, he has expanded his reputation since turning pirate. However, Badri's success has gone to his head. He fancies himself to be a dashing figure, although he is actually rather gawkish. Badir affects a black cloak and turban bedecked with black-dyed ostrich plumes, but the impression he makes with most people is that he resembles nothing more than some awkward buzzard._

_Ship's Mage:_ Yan'ad az Wani (M, 27, Ahlrain, conjurer, CN, Destiny, Haughty, Buff)  
_Yan'ad believes that a predicted alignment of the spheres will allow a mage possessed of an ancient, lost ritual to summon and control a cohort of mighty efreeti. He took service aboard the Fury so as to find a way to the city of Tolengul, where his research indicates that the ritual may be preserved. Although he is of humble birth and his arcane knowledge is as yet only modest, Yan'ad is sufficiently adept that he affects the superior air of the noble class. In truth, he fits the mold of the handsome and vigorous scions of Pashani aristocracy. He is tanned and well-muscled, the result of his years at sea and a Manual of Gainful Exercise that he acquired._

### K) Moneybag End (Mansions)

### L) Citadel Heights (High-end Businesses and Taverns)

**Brothel:** The Threefold Treasures (Excellent), Proprietor: Qiu Lishao (F, 27, Juchen, cult disciple, CE, Loyalty, Bitter, Brunette)  
_Lishao is a secret follower of Dakkar, to which worship she is fanatically devoted. Through her position as madame of the best brothel in Tortukal, she has influential contacts, which she uses to conceal the activities of her dark cult when necessary. Lishao was the daughter of a well-placed merchant of Saojung, but ran away from an arranged marriage -- right into the arms of a pirate, who sold her as a slave. Although she found her way to freedom here in Tortukal, the experience left her embittered against men in particular, but really against all humankind._

### M) Fisherman's Beach

**Ship:** Eyes of the Harbor (Pilot Keelboat, Medium), Captain: Koma Kujiri (M, 62, Daimojin, druid, LN, Survival, Offensive, Frail)  
_Exiled from Illshan because of his devotion to a nature religion, Kujiri sailed with pirates and merchants alike for decades. He is familiar with all the coasts between Hannesh in the east and Palanor in the west. Wherever his travels have taken him, Kujiri has been an outsider and he has come to return the scorn with which he has been treated. He believes that some great secret of nature lies in the harbor at Tortukal and has taken his current position because it allows him to be always on the water, attuned to the winds and currents and mysterious shifting of the breakwater reef._

### N) Southgate (Wealthy Residences)

### O) Lower Southbridge (River Docks and Rivermen's Taverns)

### P) Harbor

The harbor is protected by breakwaters that were built as part of the defenses of the ancient city. The breakwaters are arranged in three rows, each of which is comprised of several sections with gaps between them. Only the innermost row is visible above the surface and the sections mysteriously move over time. A ship that attempts to enter the harbor is likely to run aground on the breakwaters unless it is guided by someone who is intimately familiar with the harbor. Wise captains who know this wait outside the mouth of the harbor until a pilot ship comes out to guide their ship into port.

### Surrounds

Tortukal is bordered on the north by Beacon Ridge, which rises over 100 feet above the harbor. Beyond some plantations cleared here and there just outside the walls and a swamp on the northwest, the country quickly becomes dense jungle. This is the territory of the Tukumeltlapa tribe of the Quetalpa people. Their chief accepts tribute to allow the town to operate unmolested. Boatmen from the town trade game and other staples along the river, but the tribesmen do not suffer intruders on their territory.

The current chief's grandfather, one Ompamatl, made the original treaty allowing Tortukal to be founded among the ruins, which the Tukumeltlapa shunned anyway. Ompamatl's expectation that the outlanders would be soon driven away by ghosts was disappointed, but he kept his pledge anyway. His forbearance, and that of his heirs, has been rewarded with prosperity for his tribe.

**Chieftain:** Xoquima (M, 44, Quetalpa, chieftain, NG, Boredom, Condescending, Unkempt)  
_Xoquima has ruled as chief for six years. He is corpulent and unkempt, for all his finery of feathers, beads, gold, and jade. He has begun to measure himself unfavorably against the warlike deeds of his ancestors and he feels a sense of unease at how much Tortukal has grown. The feeling that he is not the chief his fathers were leads him to overcompensate and he frequently belittles his subordinates, which is particularly unwise with regards to his two counselors._

**Spirit Counselor:** Quizlixca (M, 43, Quetalpa, master druid, LE, Power, Reflective, Plain)  
_Outwardly composed and analytical, Quizlixca seethes inwardly with a lust for personal power. He pursues ever greater mastery of the power of nature, not to benefit his tribe, but to dominate others. In secret, he has begun to revive ancient Quetalpa traditions -- rites that invoke dark spirits of nature at the cost of human sacrifice._

**War Counselor:** Tlacatzin (M, 24, Quetalpa, hero, LE, Power, Reverant, Bulging)  
_Tlacatzin is muscular and pantherish. He is careful to follow the tabus of all the gods and spirits, but he has become contemptious of his chief and wouldn't half mind deposing him._

**Trade Counselor:** Tecke (M, 27, Quetalpa, tribal warrior, LN, Greed, Informed, Curly)  
_It is possible that Tecke is a half-breed as his skin is darker than is usual with the Quetalpa and his hair is curly. However that may be, he is a shrewd negotiator and his network of informants ensures that he knows everthing that goes on in the tribe and much of what happens in Tortuakal. He exploits his influence to increase his personal wealth._

## Organizations

### Merchant's Guild

**Boss:** Xiu Chui-Jiao (M, 57, Rakshasa, fiend, LE, Honor, Condescending, Sunburned)  
_A powerful, but seldom seen, figure in the town's affairs, Xiu appears as a rugged, handsome Juchen man of mature years. In truth, the leader of the Merchant's Guild is a **rakshasa**. He has a (literally) fiendish plan to suborn the town government to his will. As part of this scheme, he works behind the scenes to overturn Tortukal's "free shore" policy._

**Enforcer:** Tu Djiao-Tsu (M, 61, Juchen, illusionist, N, Friendship, Brave, Wild)  
_As a young man, Djiao-Tsu was a marketplace trickster in Saojung. He traveled to Tolengul, where he learned the deeper secrets of illusion magic. There Xiu Chui-Jiao recruited him as a henchman. Djiao-Tsu is unaware of Chui-Jao's real nature. The rakshasa is secretly amused that an adept of illusion should himself be duped by a mere glamor, but he is also careful to limit his interactions with his henchmen so they will not see through his guise. For his part, Djiao-Tsu is well-liked among the merchants and is not afraid to confront anyone who acts against their interests. He still spends his free time dabbling with illusion. His disheveled appearance is usually the result of having recently come from some experiment._

### Racketeer's Syndicate

**Boss:** Gannara Bhishuvana (M, 31, Khemez, hood, N, Loyalty, Sincere, Petite)  
_Gannara is a surprisingly short man who rose through the ranks mainly on his ability to win and keep allies. He frequently acts as a diplomat among the various factions in town and has come to see himself as a sort of statesman. Nowdays, he is all about what's good for business and woe to the punk who doesn't show respect._

**Enforcer:** Arioush Abin (M, 25, Ahlrain, hood, LN, Amusement, Reflective, Stiff)  
_Arioush was a once a retainer of a noble family of Neunazar. After their ouster, he sailed aboard a privateer, but the privations of a life at sea were little to his taste. Here in Tortukal, Arioush indulges himself in numerous vices -- among which are sadism and brutality. However debauched he may be, Arioush still retains the manner of a prim majordomo and is scrupulously loyal to his employer._

### Smugglers' Syndicate

**Boss:** Luo Ying-Shui (F, 87, Juchen, master thief, LE, Survival, Condescending, Curly)  
_Luo had a long career as a crime boss in Khanengul, but retired to the hinterlands after making too many enemies. However, he still feared assassination and decided that it was better to be in a position where he could have protectors and enforcers. Luo's decades of experience have made him confident to the point of being arrogant, but he still takes precautions in everything he does._

**Enforcer:** Mei She-Su (F, 21, Juchen, master assassin, LE, Curiosity, Bitter, Narrow)  
_She-Su was an orphan and lived on the streets of Baimin until she was taken into an Assassin's Guild at the age of 11. After a mission gone awry in which she learned just how little her life was worth to her masters, She-Su escaped to Joseong and began a career as a goon for the smugglers. Her experiences have left her deeply cynical and embittered, especially toward men. This seems to show in her very features, which are pinched and narrow. Her slit-eyed, expressionless face never betrays her emotions even when her inquisitive nature has been aroused._

### Tradesman's Guild

**Guild Master:** Ghamay Burtai (M, 39, Juchen, cult fanatic, LE, Justice, Matter-of-Fact, Olive)  
_Ghamay was a humble blacksmith among a nomad tribe of the Golden Hills. Wronged by the tribal chieftain and forced to flee his homeland, Ghamay became a devotee of Molor and followed the god's promptings even to this most unlikely location. Here he waits for a sign that the instrument of his revenge is at hand. In the meantime, Ghamay has cornered the local trade in ironmongery and has parleyed his wealth into a position of influence._

**Enforcer:** Kitbo Kurgai (M, 25, Juchen, acolyte, LE, Destiny, Malicious, Shaggy)  
_Kitbo was the roughest kind of nomad brigand until a shaman foretold that he would be killed by a horse. To avoid his fate, Kitbo took to the sea, but found it miserable. Landed in Tortukal, Kitbo was drawn to Ghamay, a fellow tribesman, and became his apprentice in both smith-work and religion. Although he pursues an honest trade these days, Kitbo still has the air of menace and unkempt appearance of a badmash of the hills. He is a terror to the apprentices and is persona non grata at most of the brothels in town due to his rough treatment of the girls._

## Adventure Hooks

### Expedition to the Ruins

Diwe Oyambala, captain of the Tides of Chaos, is interested in exploring the ruins of the ancient city that lie at the mouth of the Opalana River on Ykriz Bay. Little does she ken that sahuagin are using the ruins as a base to raid the river-tribes for pearls and human sacrifices to a dragon turtle, with which they hope to form an alliance.

### Racist Rubout

Che Shiouli, priestess of The Grotto of Our Lady of the Deeps shrine to Yshma, has a grudge against Ahlrain pirates and, acting the part of a prostitute at the Breath of the Lotus brothel, seeks to arrange the assassination of Badri bal-Kharjii, captain of The Marid's Fury.

### Election Interference

Xiu Chui-Jiao, boss of the Merchant's Guild, would like to see the repeal of the "free shores" policy. He is opposed in this by Ghamay Burtai and the Tradesman's Guild. The ship's captains are the swing vote and they are divided. In the last New Year's election, a motion to amend the town charter to permit slavery got a majority of votes, but failed to achieve a two-thirds majority. Xiu calculates that he need only eliminate a few anti-slavery captains and replace them with pro-slavery captains to make the difference. One of his targets is Diwe Oyambala, captain of the Tides of Chaos.

### A Dangerous Dingus

Aranan Drupchandra, inherited A Thief's Luck Inn from his uncle, along with something even more dangerous. When his uncle's friends, who have called from time to time to check up on him and "the secret", stopped showing up, Aranan because suspicious. Then a recent, frightening event caused him to look for someone trustworthy and world-wise to turn to for counsel.
