Tortukal is a raucous town serving pirates and smugglers who sail the Kheraz Coast. It is built at the head of a sheltered harbor on the ruins of an ancient town. Tortukal is bordered on two sides by jungle and on one side by swamp. It is, for practical purposes, only accessible by the harbor. The jungle trails to the town are watched by native Quetalpa tribesmen. Their chief accepts tribute to allow the town to operate unmolested, but the tribesmen do not suffer intruders on their territory.
