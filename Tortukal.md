# Tortukal

_Map:_ [Tortukal Map](TortukalMap.pdf)

Tortukal is a raucous town serving pirates and smugglers who sail the Kheraz Coast. It is built at the head of a sheltered harbor on the ruins of an ancient walled city. Tortukal is bordered on two sides by jungle and on one side by swamp. It is, for practical purposes, only accessible by the harbor. The jungle that surrounds the town on three sides teems with native Quetalpa tribesmen. Their chief accepts tribute to allow the town to operate unmolested. Boatmen from the town trade game and other staples along the river, but the tribesmen do not suffer intruders on their territory.

There are surprisingly few Quetalpa among the town's population, but there are many Khemez, Juchen, and even Ahlrain residents. Ahlrain and Kwanshali are commonly found in the crews of pirate and smuggler ships and Aili are not infrequently among them. Slaves, mostly Kwanshali and Khemez, perform most of the laborious tasks.

**Settlement Name:** Tortukal

## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Democracy

The town of Tortukal is governed by a form of democracy established in the Article of the Town. An Assembly meets once a week at the Great Hall. The electors to the Assembly are divided into three bodies: Captains, Merchants, and Tradesmen -- each with its own criteria for membership. At high noon on Assembly Day, the attendees from each body are counted. The number of delegates to that day's Assembly is fixed at one quarter of the attendance of the smallest representation among the three bodies. Delegates to each body are chosen by lot. A Speaker for the Assembly is elected by the body that had the highest attendance. Everyone else is sent away and the Speaker convenes the Assembly. Matters great and small are decided by a simple majority vote of the delegates. Delegates are sequestered and are compensated with 2 GP a day from the public treasury and free drinks from all the local taverns once the proceedings conclude.    

## Professions

The town has 17 households of powerful fences, pirates, and smugglers. The town is patrolled by 24 guardsmen, and there are 5 advocates to assist with legal matters. There are 33 clergymen and 3 priests.

## Districts

Tortukal is a town mostly of ramshackle buildings and thatched huts sprung up like weeds between the massive but crumbled works of a city that had long been abandoned before the rise of the Azruun Empire. The jungle grows right up to the outer walls, which were built of cut limestone filled with rubble. Even in their decay, the vine-grown towers, platforms, and foundations of the ancient city stand in sharp contrast to the newer structures in their height and solidity. Only the mansions, offices, and strongholds of the town's power brokers are well-built and in good repair.

### A) The Beacon Towers

The ruins of a pair of large, round towers stand on a ridge overlooking the north end of the harbor. Although their materials are similar to those of the walls and towers of the ancient city, their architecture and construction is quite different. But in any event, only the foundations and rings of broken stones remain.

A new beacon-hut 20 feet high has been built from reclaimed limestone blocks on the foundation of the southernmost tower. It too is round, but it is much narrower than the original tower. A watchman is on duty at all times, ready to fire a wood pyre atop the hut in the event of an attack or other emergency. A ship's bell is mounted on an iron scaffold near the hut. It and a flag-mast close by are used to give notice of the approach of vessels by way of the harbor.

### P) Harbor

The harbor is protected by breakwaters that were built as part of the defenses of the ancient city. The breakwaters are arranged in three rows, each of which is comprised of several sections with gaps between them. Only the innermost row is visible above the surface and the sections mysteriously move over time. A ship that attempts to enter the harbor is likely to run aground on the breakwaters unless it is guided by someone who is intimately familiar with the harbor. Wise captains who know this wait outside the mouth of the harbor until a pilot ship comes out to guide their ship into port.
