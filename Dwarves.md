## Dwarven History

The dwarves have detailed records of their own history since their emancipation. Except for veiled references in old sagas and a few texts held in secret archives known only to initiates of certain religious orders, the shame of their servitude to the Aelvii has been effectively censored.

### Dwarven Language

As with the elves, the divisions of the dwarven race speak dialects descended from a root language. However, because of the continued commerce and cultural interaction between the Northern Kindred and Southern Kindred, the differences between the dialects are much smaller.
