**False Appearance.** While the guardian portal is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal adamantine door.

**Immutable Form.** The guardian portal is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form -- including disintegration.

**Lightning Absorption.** Whenever the guardian portal is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the fire damage dealt.

**Magic Resistance.** The guardian portal takes no damage from spells of less than 2nd level and has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The guardian portal's weapon attacks are magical.

**Threatening Reach.** A guardian portal can make opportunity attacks against all enemies within its reach (15 feet).

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The guardian portal makes two tentacle attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the guardian portal can't use its bite attack or tentacle attack on another target.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the guardian portal, which can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against the target.

**Swallow.** The guardian portal makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is instantly imprisoned in a hostile demiplane of blackness and bitter cold. The creature is blinded and restrained, and it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the guardian portal's turns. A creature imprisoned in this manner has disadvantage on death saving throws. If it dies while imprisoned, the guardian portal regains 25 hit points.

The guardian portal can have only one creature swallowed at a time. While the guardian portal isn't incapacitated, it can regurgitate the creature at any time (no action required) in a space within 5 feet of it. The creature exits prone. If the guardian portal dies, it likewise regurgitates a swallowed creature.

**Guardian Portals** appears to be a door made of adamantine, usually massive and forbidding. It is usually placed on a solid wall no more than 5 feet thick, although it is sometimes used to replace a conventional door.

A guardian portal is usually created with a special amulet or other token item that enables the possessor to pass through the portal unharmed when grappled and swallowed, rather than taking damage and being imprisoned in a demiplane. The possessor can also instruct the guardian portal to allow creatures identified by characteristics that the portal can perceive to pass unharmed.

A guardian portal can't think or act for itself. It is perfectly obedient to the will of the possessor of its token. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words.

If a guardian portal is killed, it collapses into its demiplane, usually to reveal a blank wall of the same material as the surrounding wall.
