# Summon Swarm

_2rd-level conjuration_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  

You summon one or more swarms of tiny beasts from the area around you and cause them to gather in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

* One swarm of challenge rating 2 or lower
* Two swarms of challenge rating 1 or lower
* Four swarms of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
* Eight swarms of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

The swarms are composed of actual beasts of a type that must exist naturally in the environment within 5 miles of you when you cast this spell. For example, if you cast this spell in a desert, it is unlikely that you will be able to summon a swarm of quippers. If no creatures of the chosen type exist in the area, the spell fails and you lose the spell slot.

Each swarm gathers independently 1d4 rounds after you cast this spell. The creatures in a swarm are all killed when the swarm drops to 0 hit points and the swarms disperse when the spell ends. 

The summoned swarms are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned swarms as a group, which has its own turns. Swarms gather and act on the group's turn. The swarms obey any verbal commands within their ability that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The DM has the swarms' statistics.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more swarms appear: twice as many with a 4th-level slot, three times as many with a 6th-level slot, and four times as many with an 8th-level slot.
