# Ancient Order of the Briar

The _Ancient Order of the Briar_ is an order of fey pact warlocks. It is less a society than a lineage of master and pupil with roots that reach back to the days of the Old Kingdom. Its members share a mystical tradition, but do not necessarily hold any particular set of beliefs or goals in common. However, they are bound by oaths sworn to the powers they serve to aid one another when called on to do so. Members of the order always bear, openly or in secret, a tattoo of arcane script styled to resemble intertwined briars and thorns by which they may recognize each other.
