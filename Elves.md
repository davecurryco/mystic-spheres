# Elves

The divisions that produced _Nagoresme_, The Shattering, did not heal. The Aelvii split into two irreconcilable factions, the _Illuvarin_ and the _Dharovin_. The Aelvii called Illuvarin, guilt-stricken at the devastation they had unleashed, freed the servant races, turned their civilization markedly to the light, and experienced a cultural rebirth. Their opposites, the Dharovin, turned as sharply to darkness, building vainglorious works and waging wars with armies of slaves while brooding over their lost ascendency and vowing to regain it some day. However, neither side was willing to risk the destruction that would ensue from a resumption of direct conflict. Collectively, the Aelvii returned to insularity. Both the Illuvarin and the Dharovin further subdivided into separate civilizations. As centuries passed with little contact with the Aelvii, the other races came to lump them together under the designation _Elves_.

## Divisons of the Elves

### Illuvarin

#### Alastarii

Illuvarin of the _Alastarii_ are a technologically, magically, and culturally advanced civilization that deliberately turned to a quasi-sylvan way of life. They are attuned to nature, but are not adverse to shaping it to suit their will.

There are kingdoms of Alastarii in both the material plane and the Feywild. These kingdoms are invariably ruled by a king and queen, both individuals of great wisdom and power, who rule jointly, although one or the other may be dominant.

#### Elesanii

The _Elesanni_ are culturally advanced, but are sylvan to the point of being feral. They retain the social structures of the Illuvarin, but reject the trappings of high civilization. They prefer to live in direct harmony with the natural world and even with the Feywild. They dwell in small settlements in the deep forests and other wild places and are the consummate masters of all manner of woodcraft. Almost needless to say, the Elesannii are utterly xenophobic. Their patrols remorselessly wipe out members of any other race who trespass in their territory.

Elesanni society is egalitarian and democratic, resembling the ancient Greek democracies better than the Greeks themselves did. A Council of Elders makes executive decisions, but these must be ratified by a vote of electors which includes all adults.

### Dharovin

#### Drow

_Dharovin_ civilization mirrors that of the Alastarii, but substitutes darkness for light. As a result, their culture most resembles that of the Renaissance of the Hundred Years War period. The aristocrats vie with one another to achieve power, perpetuating an endless cycle of intrigue, feuding, warfare and banditry.

In these circumstances, a talent for machination and treachery is as valuable as prowess at arms. As more males fell in battle, Dharovin women assumed de facto headship of the noble houses. Helped along by the Aelvii tradition of matrilineal descent, this eventually became titular lordship as well. Dharovin men found themselves relegated to the roles of consort and cannon-fodder. To perpetuate this social order and advance their own ambitions, high-ranking Dharovin ladies bargained with female demons, eventually sealing a pact with the Demon Queen of Spiders that became the foundation of their priestess caste.

Twisted by these influences, the Dharovin of the Underdark came to physically reflect the darkness in their souls. Although they retained the fey beauty of the Elves, their skin became black, their hair stark white, and their eyes took on the unnatural hues of the phosphorescent crystals and growths of their new home.

#### Dharovin

Scattered groups of Dharovin refused to retreat into the Underdark and defiantly continued to live above ground on the main continent, Arestor. These Dharovin stayed aloof from demon-kind, but instead sought forbidden knowledge in their quest for dominion over all things. In contrast to the Drow, their society is both patriarchical and patrilineal, perhaps as a way of setting themselves apart from the other branches of elvenkind. These Dharovin view their lore of the Aelvii treatment of the servant races as confirmation of their self-evident right to rule over lesser beings. Their numbers dwindled and their sole remaining settlement is _Cadranislon_ (_Tolengul_, City of the Veil), a crumbling city on the shores of _Derameren_ (Darkmere) where they practice dark rites in attempts to contact beings from the Outer Worlds beyond the Veil of Stars.

#### Daimojin (Half-Dharovin)

Some thousands of years ago, a group of male Lingerer adventurers made their way to the islands of Ilshan. With their superior skills in war and magic, a handful of them conquered the native human population of the main island of and enslaved them. The Dharovin men took the most beautiful of the human women as pleasure slaves and enthusiastically mated with them, producing a breed of half-elves called the _Daimoijin_. The Dharovin raised their mixed-race children as instruments of their rule over Ilshan. Although the Daimoijin uniformly retained the black hair, dark eyes and bronze skin of their human mothers, their cruelty and will to dominate matched that of their devil-tainted fathers. Convinced of their superiority over the human population, the half-elves mated only with each other and their offspring bred true. Today the _Daimoijin_ rule over the islands of Ilshan with an iron hand, subject only to the will of the few remaining Dharovin ancestors and opposed only by the free-booting _Euijin_.

## Elven History

The Aelvii lost much lore when their civilization collapsed in civil war. Nevertheless, the elves have the longest and most complete historical record among the humanoid races. Each of the divisions of their race has kept historical records, oral traditions, and literature from its own perspective.

## Elven Language

Elves are long-lived and culturally conservative. The millennia since the sundering of the Illuvarin and Dharovin have not sufficed for the divisons of elvendom to have evolved distinct languages from the Aelvii root. Although their dialects and accents differ, even individuals from the most isolated branches, the Drow and the Elesanni, can still understand one another. The only exception to this that the Daimojin, who are only half-elven, speak Ilshanese in daily use. However, even they preserve their mother tongue of their Dharovin ancestors for ceremonial, legal, religious, and scholarly use.
