# Minor Darkness

_Evocation Cantrip_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, M (a drop of pitch)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, magical darkness spreads from the object to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere. The darkness moves with the object and spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see though darkness and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.
