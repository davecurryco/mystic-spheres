# Halflings

Halflings have a long history as a distinct race and culture, but only relatively recently have they developed social structures more organized than clans of nomadic herders and itinerant river-folk. Several hundred years ago, halflings influenced by contact with humans settled the countryside in the western coastal region of Rhunnur. They called their country "The Downshires" after its rolling chalk hills.

As the local populations of humans, goblins and the various monster races had been depleted by decades of intense warfare, the halflings enjoyed relative peace and safety. Their native industry and cleverness coupled with the advantages of fertile land and temperate climate soon made them prosperous.

## Divisions of the Halfling

Settled halflings call themselves "Dwellers" to distinguish themselves from "Roamers", their still-nomadic kindred. 

### Dwellers

The Dwellers mostly make their livings as farmers, herders, and craftsmen in the gentle, rolling hills of coastal Rhunnur. Their farms and manors are clustered around small villages and towns, linked mostly by the northern branch of the Great Road.

Dwellers are governed mainly by tradition and common sense. The heads of influential families, the country squires, and the mayors and shiriffs of the villages and towns exercise as much, if not more, local authority as does the Thain, who is the head of what central authority exists. Matters of great importance are settled by an Assembly of appropriate scope, in which all adult males are expected to participate.

### Roamers

Roamers still hold to the nomadic traditions of their ancestors. However, the presence of the settled Dwellers allows them to supplement their mainstay livelihood of herding. Many are tinkers, merchants, and travelling entertainers. A small, but significant minority make all or part of their livings through less wholesome means such as extortion, larceny, vice, and outright banditry.

The Roamers are organized into a number of clans, each headed by a matriarch. Several of the clans are essentially criminal organizations and these tend to be led by a chieftain, who wields the real power in the clan.

## Halfling History

Halflings have no written accounts that predate their Wandering. There are a few songs, stories, and myths that have origins prior to this.

## Halfling Language

Halflings originally spoke the language of the Firbolgs, who were their protectors during their wanderings in the Feywild. However, in Arestor, the halfings' contact with dwarves and humans caused them to adopt Common, although they retained many nouns and proper names from their original tongue. Once the halflings settled in the Downshire and ceased to have regular dealings with other races, their dialect diverged from standard Common. To the ears of modern Esslealoneans and Telenar colonists, the halfling dialect of Common sounds rustic, although it can still be understood.
