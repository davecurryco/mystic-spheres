# Eternal Darkness

_4th-level Evocation_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, M (a cube of black onyx worth 5gp)  
**Duration:** 24 hour  

Magical darkness fills an area you choose within range that is a 3-dimensional space up to 100 feet on a side. The darkness spreads around corners and through openings (even tiny cracks). A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.
