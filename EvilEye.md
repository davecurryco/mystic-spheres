# Evil Eye

_5th-level necromancy_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 round  

You glare at a target in range that you can see and mutter an imprecation. Your curse brings ill-fortune to the targeted creature. For the duration of the spell, the target makes saving throws with disadvantage until it fails a saving throw, at which point the spell ends. A _remove curse_ spell ends this effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the targetâ€™s saving throws are made with a -1 penalty for each slot level above 5th for the duration of the spell.
