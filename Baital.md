## Actions

**Multiattack.** The baital makes two melee attacks.

**Chill Touch.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 13 (3d6 + 3) cold damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Inhabit Corpse** The baital inhabits the corpse of a dead humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. The baital disappears and the corpse animates with the baital in control. The baital can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, condition immunities, and attacks. It otherwise uses the statistics of a zombie. Unlike a zombie, a body inhabited by a baital does not decay, although it cannot heal from physical damage.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the baital ends it as a bonus action, or the baital is turned or forced out by an effect like the _dispel evil and good_ spell. When the inhabitation ends, the baital reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse.  

**Possession (Recharge 5,6)** One humanoid that the baital can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the baital; the baital then disappears and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The baital now controls the body, but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The baital can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, condition immunities, and attacks. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. 

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the baital ends it as a bonus action, or the baital is turned or forced out by an effect like the _dispel evil and good_ spell. When the possession ends, the baital reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this baital's Possession for 24 hours after succeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

**Baital** are hostile spirits of the dead that seek to inflict misery and suffering on the living. Baital are only semi-corporeal and prefer to inhabit a corpse or possess a living person (usually a lunatic) to work their evil deeds. Baitals may also use illusion to appear as a winged skeleton; a dark, hooded figure; or a many-armed dancing spirit.
