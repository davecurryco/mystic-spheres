# Plot Matrix: Quetra, Red Mages, and Duergar

| Actor | Quetra | Red Mages | Duergar |
| ----- | ------ | --------- | ------- |
| Quetra | Quetra schemes to gain unfathomable wealth in order to buy the power she needs to break her pact with Menelkor. In the meantime, she toadies to her patron. | Quetra knows that she will one day come into conflict with Menelkor's servants so she seeks ways to neutralize or even gain control of the diabolists. | The Dark Dwarves are paving Quetraâ€™s road to riches, but if they have any future in her long-range plans, it is as slaves. |
| Red Mages | The Red Mages have orders from Rashazer to back Quetra's rule of Delastarion. | The Red Mages serve Rashazer, who has a pact with Menelkor. | The Red Mages have a deal with the duergar, many of whom are co-religionists, to maintain their labor pool. |
| Duergar | The duergar pay off Quetra to keep Delastarion running for their benefit. | The duergar increasingly regard the diabolist as hired guns under their pay. | The duergar have found untapped veins of mithril in the Mountain of Fire. Their challenge is to marshall the resources to exploit and market it without setting off a mithril-rush that would send the price plummeting. |

## Alliances

### Quetra / Pentalya

The members of the Coven of the Seven Sisters have pledged to support one another. Even so, each hag seeks her own interests first and foremost. Quetra shook herself free of Pentalya's "aid" in the control of Delastarion, but she still feeds information to her coven-sister when it suits her to do so.

### Quetra / Tyriana

When the two were rivals for Gothrog's favor, Tyriana constantly worked behind the scenes to thwart Pentalya's success. To this end, the vampiress supported Quetra in her bid to sieze the rule of Delastarion from Gorbast and his half-orc and ogre henchmen. However, Quetra double-crossed the vampiress and drove her hobgoblin allies out of the city. This left the hag and her Red Mage cohorts in control of Delastarion, but with plausible deniability of responsibility to her coven-sister. Not long after, Pentalya broke from Gothrog, which rendered her rivalry with Tyriana moot and forced the vampiress to set aside any plans she had to punish Quetra.
