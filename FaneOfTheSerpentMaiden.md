# Fane of the Serpent Maiden

A 5e adventure for 3-4 6th level characters.

# Background

In the hills to the east of Badrahar, lie the ancient ruins of a shrine to Sithryss, the demon goddess of serpents. The ancient shrine is in an inaccessable spot and its location was lost for many centuries until recently, when prospectors looking for new deposits of copper discovered the site. Affected by a nameless dread of the place, the miners left it alone, but word of the find reached the owner of a local mine owner, Belshar bal-Asram, who came to see the site himself. Later, when Belshar's men working a copper mine breached a sealed cave that contained ancient crypts, he noticed that carvings on the tombs incorporated a motif similar to that of the green stone disc. Belshar took items recovered from crypts, including a jade bracelet in the form of two intertwined serpents, to Khanashar, where he was pursued by assassins of a snake cult connected to the ancient sites. Both the bracelet and a hand-drawn map showing the way to the shrine site ended up in the hands of Yasreena, Belshar's paramour.

Unknown to the adventurers and even to herself, Yasreena is a descendent of a line of priestesses of Sithryss. Since the time she first came into contact with the bracelet, Yasreena has been compelled by a _geas_ to seek out a temple of the snake-goddess and assume her hereditary duties.

# Prelude

## Shrine Ruins

The ruins of the shrine lie hidden in a grove of scrub oak. Little is left of the buildings, but a circular court made of huge slabs of greenish stone, heaved and cracked with time and weather, can be found among the rank weeds that overgrow the site. At the very center of the court is a cairn of broken stone raised by the miners at Belshar's orders. Beneath the cairn is a massive disc of dark, mottled green stone, carved with the image of two intertwined snakes, each devouring the other, within a border of characters in a strange, curving script.

The disc is a teleportation circle paired with another such disc in the Pyramid Ruins. It can be activated by Yasreena while she is wearing the jade bracelet. The clue to this is that Yasreena will recall that Belshar wanted her to come here, telling her, "You are the key!"

# Main Adventure

## Pyramid Ruins

_Map: Dodecahedron 2016 - Ruined Pyramid Complex (page 18)_

The pyramid complex is nestled against the side of a smouldering volcano surrounded by thick jungle. A lava flow has buried the northwest corner of the site, but this must have happened some time ago because the volcanic rock is covered in shrub vegetation and small trees. The forest cover conceals the mouth of a cave in the cliff-face above the northernmost pyramid.

The pyramids are built of limestone cemented together and clad in large blocks of greenish cantera stone. The Temple building is also  constructed of limestone with a cantera veneer. The other buildings were built of a lighter volcanic stone covered in thick stucco. The serpent columns and ornamental features of the buildings are carved of a dark green serpentinite with mottled inclusions.

### Teleportation Circle

The teleportation circle deposits the adventurers in the southwest corner of the map facing the pyramids to the north with impenetrable jungle at their backs.

A group of 11 **monkeys** feeding at the base of the tree to the southwest of the South Pyramid retreats to its branches at the adventurers' approach.

### South Pyramid

A litter of humanoid bones lies at the foot of the south steps. A successful DC 10 Perception(Wisdom) check will reveal that many of the bones have been chewed and some have been split for the marrow. A successful DC 15 Investigation(Intelligence) check will reveal that the bones are of various ages, some many decades old and some only a few years old. No skulls are to be found among the bones.

The pillars on the third level of the pyramid are of dark green serpentinite carved in the form of intertwined serpents.

On the top level, post-holes indicate that a wooden structure was once built atop the pyramid. However, all traces of this have vanished. At the center of the level, a crude altar constructed of logs has been erected. The wood is weathered and the sisal ropes holding it together are rotten. 

### South Building

This was once a ceremonial building for use by the priests. The carved wooden doors have long since rotted away from their stone frames and the thatch roof and its timbers likewise. Inside, beneath a loose stone in the debris-covered flags of the floor, is a small coffer of soapstone carved with an elaborate motif of snakes coiling through skulls.

**Treasure: (coffer)** Leopard Fur Mask (decayed to scraps) set with Star rose quartz (100 gp), Crystal Jar (150 gp), Dust of Disappearance (uncommon, dmg 166)  

### South Colonnade

The columns have bases carved in the shape of serpent heads and the capitals are carved in the shape of their tails.

If the adventurers spend any significant amount of time here, a group of 7 **carnivorous apes** will drop from the trees and attack. An individual ape will flee if it loses 1/2 of its hit points, but it may simply retreat to the shelter of the trees and hurl rocks, especially if the others are still engaged in combat with the adventurers.

### East Pyramid

A band of 20 **monkeys** suns themselves on the lower levels of the southwest face of this pyramid. They will show curiosity toward the adventurers, but will scamper away if anyone approaches within 30 feet. 

The top level of this pyramid once supported a wooden shrine that had a floor inlaid with mosaic tiles of serpentinite and jade. The mosaic has been ruined by the weather, but a few of the jade tiles are intact and can be recovered. Some of the jade tiles are carved with stylized human faces wearing elaborate headdresses formed of multiple cobra heads. Others are carved with snake heads surrounded with stylized feathers. At the center of the tiles is a disc of green stone much like the one in the Shrine Ruins. However, this disc is weathered and cracked.

**Treasure:** Carved jade tiles (8 @25 gp)

### Central Building Complex

The ruins of a complex of buildings lie between the North Pyramid and the South Pyramid. The walls are mostly reduced to rubble, except for those of a building at the northeast corner of the complex. This building once housed scribes of the temple.

The northeast diagonal wall of the northeast building once supported wooden shelves that have rotted away. Fragments of dried-clay tablets inscribed with rows of the script found on the teleportation disk lie in a heap on the floor. Among these are a few broken soapstone tablets carved with the same script. If the adventurers find a means to read the script, they will find the writings to be mostly concerned with the movements of the stars. However, among the more interesting snippets are the following:

> and in the dark clouds between the stars, the Ancient Ones float on the seas of Chaos. Blessed be She Who Guards, for the Veil lies between us and they do not see, even in their farthest-reaching dreams. But eons are as nothing to those who lie asleep and the Veil grows threadbare. They do not see, but they could be called, so thin has it grown. Suffer no one to attempt this, for theirs is a thirst for the blood of worlds. Even She Who Devours could not match their hunger...  

> so it happened in the year 5 Python of the Iron Cycle that the human slaves of the western province of Hseth'ssra revolted. At the outset, seven Priestesses of the Temple at Thu'saa'shiss were slain and scores of lesser Children beside. The rebellion spread rapidly east, for the plantations had many slaves and but few guards and overseers. But at the gates of the city of Athyss'la...  

> for nine nights the Temple steps ran with blood, so many were the captives that the armies of Lath'syss brought back in bonds from her conquest of the swarthy humans of the eastern coastlands. All the Children who dwelt in Ssa'hsu'lyss feasted so that they lay in torpor for half a moon afterward...  

### North Pyramid

At the top of this pyramid is a shrine of limestone with a multi-tier roof of the same material. A corbel arch in the east wall of the shrine faces the Temple.

The northwest corner of the pyramid is half-buried in volcanic rock from a lava-flow.

### North Colonnade

The columns are carved in the shape of intertwined serpents with seven hooded cobra heads at the capitals. In the center of the court stands a crude wooden rack in which scores of skulls are set. Many of the skulls are human, but others are reptilian, and some are humanoid, but smaller and with pointed teeth.

When the adventurers get to this spot, they will be attacked by a **giant ape** that will bound down from the cave above the north pyramid, onto the pyramid itself, and then down onto the colonnade court. The ape will focus on capturing Yasreena, but will ferociously attack anyone who seeks to thwart him. In this situation, Yasreena will instinctively flee toward the doors of the Temple, where the guardian statues will protect her from the beast.

### Temple

The Temple is faced in cantera stone, smooth and bluish-green. Its design features corbel arches and elaborate bas-relief friezes depicting serpentine motifs.

#### Exterior Doors

The main doors of the temple are rectangular affairs of cast bronze green with the patina of antiquity and decorated with friezes depicting demonic figures with the upper bodies of men and the lower bodies of snakes. The doors are locked with an Arcane Lock with a password that is a prayer to Sithryss. Yasreena knows the password.

In alcoves on each side of the entryway are two large serpentinite statues of snake-headed men with six arms. On each statue, two arms are crossed over the chest, two are opposed high and low, and two are opposed front and back. On the crossed arms, one hand holds a _khopesh_ short-sword and one hand holds a fan that resembles a cobra's head. Of the arms opposed high and low, one holds a lightning-bolt and the other holds a double-headed mace. One empty hand is extended forward in a gesture of warning and the other empty hand is pushed back in symmetry. The statues are **stone watchers** charged to guard the shrine from interlopers. They will use their attacks against any creature except Yasreena that attempts to enter the temple.

#### Sanctum

The large center room of the temple is the sanctum dedicated to worship of the Snake Maiden, Nagakanya. The room is dark, but once all the adventurers are inside, the doors will close and a set of troughs set along the bases of the north and south walls will fill with perfumed oil which will mysteriously ignite, illuminating the entire room with bright light within 5 feet and dim light for 30 feet beyond.

In the floor toward the east end of the room is round pit lined in dark-green serpentinite with border decorations carved with a motif of serpents twining around skulls. An alcove in the east wall holds a frieze carved from white soapstone set into the limestone blocks of the wall. The central figure of the bas-relief carving depicts, in larger-than-life-sized, realistic detail, a creature with the head, voluptuous torso, and arms of a woman; a pair of eagle-like wings; and the lower body of a serpent. This _nagakanya_, or Serpent Maiden, is surrounded by smaller figures of half-snake, half-human attendants against a stylized background representing some infernal realm. She wears an elaborate headdress carved of jade topped with the heads of five hooded cobras cast from gold. Her hands are stretched forth in an attitude of presentation holding a real (not carved) conch shell decorated with gold filigree and gems. Her bracelets, earrings, and belt are made of gold set with semi-precious and precious stones. Although the soapstone is pale, the nagakanya's face is distinctively Khemez, with the typical bold eyebrows, sloe eyes, and bridged nose.

Once the doors of the temple close, Yasreena will be compelled by the _geas_ to undress and dance before the altar. Each turn she does so, she must roll a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be possessed by the spirit of her forbears. Once possessed, she will assume the stats and powers of a **snake priestess**. Transforming her motions to a _hypnotic dance_, she will attempt to charm the other adventurers. Whether this succeeds or fails, she will move to the alcove, take the conch shell, and blow it to summon 4 **yuan-ti malisons** from the frieze, who will appear in unoccupied squares next to the alcove. Yasreena will then demand the adventurers' surrender, saying that she will spare them for old times' sake if they will vow to serve Sithryss. If they adventurers refuse, she will order the malisons to attack and then join in herself. In addition, the carving of the nagakanya will radiate a _hallow_ spell (Yasreena's choice as to the form).

**Treasure:** 4600 gp (inlays and decorations), Carved jade from headdress (250 gp), Bloodstones from belt (5 @50 gp), Gold earrings set with jaspers (250 gp), Conch shell decorated with gold and set with sardonyx (250 gp), Jade gemstones (5 @50 gp)

## Cenote Dungeon

_Map: Dodecahedron 2016 - Wygralak's Hole (page 61)_

The Temple was built over a cenote. The pit in the floor of the Sanctum plunges downward through the limestone rock for 30 feet and then opens on the ceiling of a large cavern. Over 120 feet below this is a pool of fresh water 30 feet deep and clear. Natural ledges in the walls of the cavern have been artificially improved with stairs and sections built up with limestone blocks. A stone bridge extends over a neck of the cavern and stone doors are set into doorways carved from the rock in several places along the ledges.
