**Magical Resistance.** The skull lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Marshal Undead.** Unless the skull lord is incapacitated, it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.

**Confusing Gaze.** When creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the skull lord and is able to see the skull lord’s eye sockets, the skull lord can magically force it to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, unless the skull lord is incapacitated.
On a failed saving throw, the creature can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes one melee attack agains a random creature, or it does nothing if no creature is in reach.
Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the skull lord until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the skull lord in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

**Spellcasting.** The skull lord is a 11th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The skull lord has the following cleric, paladin, and wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): _ray of frost, sacred flame, thaumaturgy, true strike_  
1st level (4 slots): _command, magic missile, shield of faith, wrathful smite_  
2nd level (3 slots): _crown of madness, hold person, silence_  
3rd level (3 slots): _bestow curse, dispel magic_  
4th level (3 slots): _fire shield, guardian of faith_  
5th level (2 slots): _geas, mislead_  
6th level (1 slot): _mass suggestion_  

In addition, the skull lord can cast divination, legend lore, and zone of truth once per day each without using components or expending spell slots.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The skull lord can cast three spells of up to 2nd level, make three quarterstaff attacks, or take any combination of these actions.

**Bone Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Legendary Actions

The skull lord can take 3 legendary actions (one with each head), choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The mummy lord regains spent legendary actions the start of its turn.

**Imperious Word.** The Skull of the Present speaks a one-word command to a creature the skull lord can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The target creature must be able hear the skull lord, but need not understand the skull lord’s language to be affected. If the command is directly harmful to the creature, it can make a second DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, but must follow the command if it fails. If the second saving throw succeeds, the creature is paralyzed on its next turn.

**Blasphemous Word.** The Skull of the Past, the skull lord utters a blasphemous word. Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of the skull lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the skull lord’s next turn.

**Word of Negation.** The Skull of the Future utters a mystical word. A target creature within 10 feet of the skull lord that can hear the magical utterance must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the effects of one action of the skull lord’s choice taken by the target in the turn in which the skull lord uses this action are negated. Items, charges, or spell slots expended in the negated action are restored. It may seem that the skull lord has changed the past, but actually it has foretold the future and shaped the course of events to avoid an undesired outcome.

**Brarin son of Tharlin** is an undead commander who Angrim constructed from the embalmed corpses of the three high-level members of the cult of Abbathor who had conspired to thwart his will in the matter of his undeath. His name, which literally means "slave born of betrayal", is an ironic reference to this. To the mummy of the paladin, Angrim attached the skulls of the cleric and wizard. In some unanticipated way, each of the three skulls of the resulting conjoined undead gained the ability to see into a separate time. The paladin’s skull sees in the present, while the cleric skull sees into the past, and the wizard skull sees into the future.
