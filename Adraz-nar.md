# Necropolis of Adraz-nar

An ancient and delipated dwarven necropolis which contains the mausoleums of two noble families of the dwarves -- the Line of Dalbor and the Line of Ezgroth. There is also a ruined shrine to the almost-forgotten dwarven god of mountaintops, Zoldin.

The grounds are tended by Elgrim the Forsaken, Zoldir's last surviving worshipper in the South.
