# Necropolis of Adraz-nar

An ancient and delipated dwarven necropolis which contains the crumbling mausoleums of two noble families of the dwarves -- the Line of Dalbor and the Line of Ezgroth. There is also a ruined shrine to the almost-forgotten dwarven god of mountaintops, Zoldin.

The grounds are tended by Ezgrim the Forsaken, Zoldir's last surviving worshipper in the South. The ancient priest is beset by a coven of hags, The Forsworn Sisters, who delight in tormenting him. Despite Zoldir's faithful efforts to maintain the enhallowments protecting the mountain's sacred sites, the Sisters have managed to damage the site with avalanches and infest some of the mausoleums and even the shrine itself with demons.

### General

The necropolis is situated at 18,000 feet above sea level in the cleft of a pass near the summit of Zithrak Zolmir, the Mountain of the High Peak. It is a desolate place of snow, ice, and weathered stone bared by the howling wind. A column of grey basalt fashioned in an ancient dwarven style rises from the main track where a ramp leads down into the two main sections. The column is amazingly unweathered. Dwarven runes are crisply incised in vertical columns down each of its four faces, which are oriented to the cardinal directions. The runes, which are written in an ancient mode, read:

_South Face_  
> Hail Zoldir, Lord of the High Peaks, who shelters his folk beneath the roots of the mountains!  

_West Face_  
> Hail Zoldir, Thunderer, who smites down the enemies of his folk!  

_North Face_  
> Hail Zoldir, Lord of the High Passes, who invigorates his folk with the bracing wind of his breath!  

_East Face_  
> Hail Zoldir, Fire-Bringer, who banishes darkness that his folk may not fear!  

### Line of Dalbor

A square stone pillar, much weathered, stands on the path leading to the northern section of the necropolis. At the top of the pillar, a column of large dwarven runes written in the same antique mode as the pillar on the main path reads "The Line of Dalbor". Further columns of smaller runes beneath list dwarven names arranged 

#### A - Tomb of Dalbor

A fence of wrought iron, bent and broken in many places but strangely unrusted, stands around a tomb of weathered white marble. The superlative architecture and craftsmanship of the tomb are still evident, even though the ornate carvings are mostly effaced by the ravages of wind and frost.

The door of the tomb is a single slab of stone set with skill into its surrounding frame and sealed with lead. Dwarven runes reading "Dalbor, King of Kaddash-mir sleeps within" are incised in the door. The gold-leaf inlay of the runes is still bright and unweathered. However, a crack wide enough to thrust an arm through divides the stones diagonally from top to bottom along the back of the tomb. The crack affords a view of the tomb's interior.

Inside the tomb, a poryphry and marble sarcophagus lies open and empty. Its lid, carved in the likeness of King Dalbor himself in repose, lies on the floor alongside. Two smaller sarcophagai of white marble flank Dalbor's sarcophagus. Their lids, which bear runes identifing their occupants as Naan and Mir, are likewise tumbled onto the floor. It is not apparent from the viewing angle of the crack, but all the tombs are empty.

#### B - Empty Tomb

This white marble tomb is in much better condition than the others in this part of the necropolis as it is almost a millenia newer. However, there has been some damage from rockslides on the southeast corner and, more significantly, the marble door is missing entirely. Within, a lidless stone sarcophagus stands empty.

#### C - Tomb of Gimbor son of Baldin

The door to this tomb stands open by a foot and the lintel is overgrown with a strange blackish-green lichen. Dwarven runes carved into the door identifiy this tomb: "Here rests Gimbor, son of Baldin, son of Dalbor, Lord of Kaddash-mir, Suzerain of Miraz-drir".

In the darkness within the tomb, the embalmed bodies of three dwarves, two female and one male, writhe together in an obscene mockery of lovemaking atop a marble sarcophagus in the center of the chamber. These are the corpses of Gimbor and his wives, possessed and animated by three Dybbuks.

The sarcophagus and two stone coffins set in niches on either hand are empty, although the lids have been set back in their places.

_Monsters:_

Alkilith, 3 x Dybbuk

#### D - Tomb of Baldin son of Dalbor

Baldin extended the wealth and power of the domain he inherited from his father. His tomb too, is larger and more elaborate, although it lacks a boundary fence. Due to protective enchantments, the white marble roof and walls of the mausoleum are practically unweathered and the door is intact and still sealed. Gold-inlaid runes on the door read, "At rest from his mighty labors, here reposes Baldin, son of Dalbor, Lord Sovereign of Kaddash-mir and Alkan-drir and Lord Protector of Miraz-drir. His deeds are immortal and his line will ever endure."

The door of the mausoleum is sealed with an amalgam of silver and protected by a _Glyph of Warding: Spell Glyph: Whirlwind (xgte 171)_ which will trigger if the seal is broken.

The interior of the tomb is comprised of cross-vaulted chambers. White crystals set into the apex of each arch cast a soft, unwavering light on each chamber. At the intersection of the chambers, a magnificent sarcophagus of poryphry and green marble with gold fittings stands on a pedestal of black granite. On its lid, a life-size statue in the image of Baldin lies in repose. The statue's hands grasp the begemmed hilt of a glittering broadsword with a damasked blade inlaid with runes of portent. Runes inlaid in platinum on each face of the pedestal proclaim this to be the final repose of Baldin son of Dalbor and extoll his great virtues and mighty deeds.

The crypts of Baldin's wives Flan, Niri, and Mir, lie beneath slabs of rose marble set in the white marble floor of the chambers before and to either side of the central sarcophagus.

The sarcophagus is trapped. If the sword is touched or the sarcophagus or its lid is moved, the trap will trigger. Wrought-iron portcullises will fall down from the ceiling to form a cage around the intersection of the chambers and seal off the entrance. The white crystals in the ceiling will radiate an _anti-magic field_ which will cover each of the wings of the tomb, excluding only the intersection of the chambers. The sword attacks any creature trapped in the intersection cage as a _Dancing Sword_ wielded by Baldin: _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage. These effects will last one minute, after which the portcullises will withdraw, the crystals will cease to radiate anti-magic, and the sword will return to its place.

_Treasure:_

Cursed weapon, broadsword (-2)

This blade appears to be a _Dancing Sword_, but it is cursed and attunement extends the curse to you. In addition to the -2 to hit and damage penalty, this unlucky blade causes its wielder to fumble on an attack roll of 1 or 2 and deals 1d8 of slashing damage to its wielder on any fumble. Nevertheless, as long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the sword, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.

#### E - Ossuary of the Line of Dalbor

This mausoleum is built in the form of a two-story tower of grey marble with a pedestal and roof of white marble. The stones of the mausoleum and their ornamental carvings are much weathered. At the front of the monument, a set of steps leads up to an iron door protected by an iron gate, both heavily coated with rust. The door and gate are protected by locks which are frozen and so can only be opened by force sufficent to destroy the lock.

Inside the ossuary, niches in the walls contain the skulls and bones of hundreds of Dalbor's descendents, among which were a number of unsavory characters. The evil influences exercised by the Forsworn Sisters have caused the spirits of these black sheep to haunt the mausoleum as wraiths. Each wraith has 1-4 spectres at its command. During the day these undead confine themselves to the interior of the ossuary, but at night they roam the northern end of the necropolis freely. The wraiths are calculating enough to stalk their intended victims and wait until a strong party has been weakened before they attack. 

A modest hoard of electrum bars is hidden beneath a loose flagstone in the floor of the ossuary -- the legacy of a transaction between a swindler and a priest, both long dead. The bars are encased in the rotted remains of a pine box and bear proof-marks from the reign of Madrezakar II over 800 years before the present. 

_Monsters:_

6 x Wraith, 12 x Spectre

_Treasure:_

Electrum bars (1,200 gp)

### Line of Ezgroth

#### F - Tomb of Brarin son of Frair son of Ezgroth

This white marble mausoleum is weathered, but unspoiled. It is of a rather plain design and what little ornamental carving there was on its stones has largely been effaced. The runs on the still-sealed door are barely legible, and can be read only as "Brarin... Frair son of... o..".

Inside the tomb is a plain sarcophagus of limestone, which contains the skeletal remains of Brarin, flanked by the limestone-topped crypts of his wife Glir and son Flar -- so identified by plain runes engraved in shallow runes on the soft stone. The family had fallen on hard times and could not afford a more costly entombment. Their grave goods, which amount to a few silver belt-buckles, a gold signature-ring, and an heirloom gold necklace, are worth less than 500 gp.

#### G - Tomb of Darin son of Frair son of Ezgroth

This modest grey marble tomb encloses a crypt in which are encased the mortal remains of Brarin's younger brother Darin. The stone door is still sealed and the inscription on it is more legible than the one on Brarin's tomb. It reads simply, "Darin son of Frair son of Ezgroth". The crypt is little more than a limestone slab covering a hole in which Darin's unembalmed body was deposited in a wooden coffin -- a sign of desparate times. Diligent search will uncover 6 gp, 12 sp, and a silver cloak-clasp among the mould surrounding Darin's dry bones.   

#### H - Tomb of Brair son of Ezgroth

This elaborate white marble tomb is in shabby condition. The door, which was apparently broken down and then set roughly back in place, is now blocked off by a large slab of stone -- the work of an elemental summoned by Ezgrim to trap a demon and its undead followers within.

_Monsters:_

Devourer, 4 x Ghast

#### I - Tomb of Mim wife of Ezgroth

This elaborate, but decayed mausoleum of rose marble stands south of the rubble of Ezgroth's mausoleum. It is the tomb of Ezgroth's favorite wife, Mim, whose legendary cunning helped her husband found a powerful dynasty. In particular, Mim secured an alliance between Ezgroth and her brother Frar, who became High Priest of Zoldin.

The door of the mausoleum lies in rubble and a strange blackish-green lichen clings to the lintel and doorposts. In the gloom of a large niche at the back of the elaborately-vaulted central chamber stands an even stranger statue -- a larger-than-life, verdigrised bronze statue of a many-armed woman with the body of snake. The lichen is, in fact, an Alkilith conjured here by the Forsworn Sisters. The statue is a Marilith demon who came through the portal opened by the Alkilith. The Marilith has covered herself in a glamor to make it seem that she is a statue, a boon from the demon-lord who sent her hence. She has commanded the Alkilith to grab a creature in range of its tentacles, thrust it within the chamber, and then cover the door with a portal to the Abyss. If possible, the Marilith will choose the most physically-imposing member of the party for this treatment, as she relishes single combat with a worthy (but beatable) opponent.

_Monsters:_

Alkilith, 1 x Marilith

#### J - Tomb of Frair son of Ezgroth

In contrast to the neighboring tomb of his son Darin, this mausoleum declares the opulence and eminence of Frair, who was a High Priest of Zoldin at the zenith of the god's worship and the dwarves' power. Masterwork stonemasonry and enchanted runes have preserved the tomb from weather and evil influences alike. The door to the tomb is of burnished bronze -- untouched by verdigris. It is held closed by an Arcane Lock that will open only to those who display the holy symbol of Zoldin -- a stylized mountain crowned with thunderbolts.

A large, elaborately-carved white marble sarcophagus is set in the center of the interior space of the selpulchre. At the foot of the sarcophagus, facing the door, is an ornate bronze fountain decorated with geometric motifs. Jets of clear water play from spouts in the form of stylized trout. Like the door, the fountain shows no sign of age or mineralization from the water. This fountain is an example of dwarven craftsmanship in metal and enchantment at the height of their mastery in the South Continent. In fact, the elemental and clerical magic that keeps the water pure will confer resistance to poison for 24 hours to any creature who drinks it.

On either side of the central sarcophagus are smaller marble crypts in which are interred the wives of Frair -- Geia, Frei, Lon, and Dira. Each of these imprisons an invisible stalker bound to slay any creature who opens the sarcophagus without having performed the appropriate rituals dedicated to Zoldin. The central sarcophagus is warded by four such invisible stalkers. The embalmed bodies of Frair and his wives are interred in silver coffins inside lead coffins. Frair's body bears ornaments worth 800 gp, 60 pp. His stiff hands bear a golden rod of office decorated in stylized thunderbolts. The rod is an imitation of the actual article and is not only non-magical but hollow as well. Nonetheless, it is worth 500 gp as an art object. The bodies of Frair's wives bear 390 gp, 390 gp, 320 gp, and 360 gp respectively in personal ornaments.

#### K - Tomb of Khaz Stronghands

Empty

#### L - Ossuary of the Line of Ezgroth

This mausoleum is similar in construction and decoration to the ossuary in the north of the necropolis. It is in even worse condition, however, as it was subject to spiteful mischief from a sending of the Forsworn Sisters. The iron door and its protecting gate, equally rusty, have been wrenched open and the floor inside is heaped knee-high with the bones and skulls of Ezgroth's descendants. Ezgrim means to organize the bones and restore them to their niches, but has been too busy warding off new affronts by the coven.

#### M - Tomb of Glarin son of Ezgroth

Like his brother Frair, Glarin was wealthy and powerful. His business interests were intertwined throughout the economy of the valley. His mausoleum, however grand it was at the time of its construction, is now quite weathered as it lacked the magical protections placed on Frair's tomb. However, such was the quality of its craftsmanship and materials that the verdigris-covered bronze door is still sealed, the roof is sound, and the sepulchure within is unspoiled.

As a dwarf of great wealth, Glarin hated thieves. He could not abide the thought that tomb-robbers might disturb his eternal repose. In his will, he stipulated that his heirs design certain features into his mauseoleum to forstall this. Glarin set aside a great deal of money to ensure that the protections would be of the very best and most lasting quality.

The door of the tomb is actually steel sheathed in bronze and sealed all around with lead. It is locked with an internal mechanism that, once locked, cannot be unlocked again. The mechanism incorporates a patented double-lock that will defeat a _knock_ spell -- unlocking one lock automatically locks the other.

Glarin's white marble sarcophagus in the center of the tomb is topped with a larger-than-life bronze statue of the great dwarf himself -- a figure of proud mein standing upright and bearing an open book in one hand and a surveyor's rod in the other.

_Monsters:_

Alkilith, 3 x Dybbuk

#### Q - Ruined Nave

Under normal circumstances, the party will first encounter Ezgrim sweeping the floor of this chamber with his back turned to the exterior. The thick stone walls still support the damaged roof, but they are crumbling and look unstable. Ezgrim seems unconcerned and goes about his task with slow, stiff motions, head bent in concentration. He trusts to his circlet to warn him of the approach of enemies and will not be aware of the presence of others until they are within 10 feet of him unless they make a very loud noise or otherwise attract notice.

The Nave is covered by a _Hallow_ spell (extra effect: _Daylight_) cast by Ezgrim to contain the demons in the Sanctum. He sweeps the floor as a "light activity" to keep awake while he takes a long rest to recover his spell slots so that he can deal with them. Natural light from the gaps in the roof fills the chamber so the characters may not notice the bright light from the _Daylight_ effect.

Ezgrim's reaction to visitors will depend on their intent toward him and this sacred site. He needs allies against the Forsworn Sisters, but he will take time to make certain of the alignment  

#### R - Sanctum

Ezgrim trapped several shadow demons in the Sanctum chamber of the shrine, but he did not have enough spell slots remaining to cast _Banishment_ on all of them. The demons are considerably discomforted by the sacred character of the chamber, but cannot leave due to the enhallowments placed on its very stones. Consequently, they skulk in shadowed corners away from the painful light of the Nave, in the hope that they might revenge themselves on Ezgrim -- or indeed, any creature who might enter the chamber unaware.

A single white marble enaged column at the back of the chamber supports the arches that uphold the ceiling. The column is incised with four vertical columns of dwarven runes inlaid in gold leaf. The text of each column of runes is a prayer to the god Zoldin:

> Lord Zoldin our Protector, shelter us with your indominable will, stronger than the foundations of the mountains

> Lord Zoldin our Avenger, punish our foes with your invincible wrath, swifter than the lightning of the skies

> Lord Zoldir our Motivator, inspire us with your inexhaustable vigor, brisker than the gusts of the high passes

> Lord Zoldir our Sustainer, comfort us with your incalculable beneficence, warmer than the rays of the noonday sun

The demons cannot approach within 5 feet of the column.

_Monsters:_

6 x Shadow Demon

#### S - Tomb of the Heroes:

This burial vault contains nine stone niches in which are interred the remains of a line of paladins dedicated to Zoldin in the days of the god's veneration among the dwarves. Each such paladin entered his service to Zoldin by taking an heirloom, a Rod of Lordly Might, from the dead hands of his predecessor, whose body was placed on a marble slab at the center of the chamber. The last of the paladins, bereft of divine power, laid down his charge by placing the rod on the slab, where it remains.

_Treasure:_

Rod of Lordly Might

## People

### Forsworn Sisters

The Sisters were once devotees of Zoldin, but they were embittered by the limited role available to female adepts in the dwarven cult and fell -- first to apostasy and then to demon-worship. Each of the sisters represents a perversion of one of the aspects of the god Zoldin. 

**Annis Hag:** Sister Gerta Strongbones  

Sister Gerta is the tribe mother of a pack of trolls that stalk the wooded mountain-sides of the Forbidden Canyon. She takes periodic absences to maintain her guise as a kindly wise-woman among the shepard-folk of ni-Shuba, where she delights in corrupting young children and persuading them to misbehave and run away from home -- never to return. She carries a whistle carved from the fingerbone of a stone giant that when blown, will trigger an avalanche or mudslide in any area of unstable rock or earth within 1 mile.

**Bheur Hag:** Sister Fannie Frostbite  

Sister Fannie enjoys hunting travelers in the high mountain passes with her minons, a mated pair of Abominable Yetis. She carries a whistle crafted from the fingerbone of a frost giant that when blown, will trigger an avalance in any area of unstable snow within 1 mile.

**Night Hag:** Sister Smegra Shadowblight  

Sister Smegra maintains an alter-ego as a harmless bird-tamer and soothsayer in Shabo and only occasionally visits her sisters in the Forbidden Canyon. She travels to and from her two abodes by means of a [Lariat of Teleportation](LariatOfTeleportation.md), which she sometimes uses to hurl foes to inconvenient locations around the Hidden Valley. She carries a whistle made of a raven claw on a thong around her neck with which she can summon 2d4 swarms of ravens or 2d6 + 4 kenku to serve her bidding.

**Storm Hag:** Sister Cracklepate Catatumbo  

Sister Cracklepate lives in the ruins of a dwarven observatory at the peak of the mountain. The place is subject to lightning strikes, which suits her just fine. She has traffic with a clan of evil cloud giants in the guise of a mendicant wise woman of their race called Frygyra. As a boon from a cloud giant lord, she carries a ram's horn at her belt which she can blow as an action to magically summon a bodyguard of two cloud giant warriors who appear in an unoccupied space the hag can see within 90 feet. The bodyguard are under their lord's orders to obey their summoner's commands, but they are not under any other compulsion. The summoned bodyguard must serve for up to 1 hour and are magically recalled to their home base when they drop to 0 hit points or when their time of service is up. Sister Crackepate prefers that the cloud giant lord remains in her debt rather than the other way around so she will only call on her body guard when absolutely necessary.

**Coven Powers**

As a coven, the four Sisters wield additional powers. However, they must often wander far from their lair to find suitable humanoid populations to torment. Consequently, their coven powers only require a quorum (three of the four) to be present. The sisters take it in turn to spend a month in the field. Each of the Sisters has a blue tooth that allows the hag to use an action to cast a _sending_ spell that is targeted simultaneously to all other members of the coven.

**Shared Spellcasting.** While at least three members of the hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:

1st level (4 slots): _comprehend languages, identify, unseen servant_  
2nd level (3 slots): _hold person, skywrite, zone of truth_  
3rd level (3 slots): _bestow curse, magic circle, summon lesser demons_  
4th level (3 slots): _phantasmal killer, summon greater demon_  
5th level (2 slots): _planar binding, scrying_  
6th level (1 slot): _planar ally_  
7th level (1 slot): _whirlwind_

For casting these spells, each hag operates at the level, DC, and attack bonus of the hag with the highest CR present.

### Shrine to Zoldin

**Archpriest:** Ezgrim the Forsaken (M, 1000+, CG, Greed, Condescending, White-haired)  
Ezgrim is ancient and withered. He moves with slow deliberation (Speed: 15 ft.), is nearly deaf, and speaks barely above a whisper. His unkempt white beard reaches to his knees and he keeps his long, snowy hair out of his eyes with a circlet of tarnished silver (actually, a _Circlet of Enemy Detection_ coated with lampblack). He wears layers of threadbare winter clothes rudely fashioned from furs, leather, and rough woolen cloth. He carries a _Staff of the Mountaintops_ to which has affixed a bundle of twigs for use as a besom.

In his youth, Ezgrim was tempted away from his faith and became a figure in the rising cult of Abbathor. He repented and ever since has sought to redeem himself in the solitary service of Zoldin, but he still struggles with greed. He projects an extravagent humility which belies his pride in the longevity and ancient lineage of his race. He is often supercilious toward members of shorter-lived races. Ezgrim is familiar with the ancient history of the valley, but he has been isolated atop the mountain for the past few centuries and knows little about more recent events. In particular, he knows nothing of the Sorceress -- nor does she know anything about him for that matter.
