**Stalkers** are human-feline hybrids. Males typically stand about 5 feet tall and weigh 100 to 120 pounds. Females tend to be somewhat smaller, but both sexes are agile and muscular. Depending on their habitat, stalkers may have the coloration of a cougar, panther, or leopard. Although they resemble lycanthropes in hybrid form and have many of the characteristics of such, they are not actually afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy. They cannot change shape, but neither do they enjoy immunity from damage from non-magical, non-silvered weapons.

Stalkers usually live in remote forests or mountains, far from civilization. Although they are intelligent, their psychology and culture stems from their lives as solitary hunters. It is difficult for them to comprehend the ways of other humanoids and they are prone to regard any creatures who encroach on their territory as prey. However, some stalkers who come into contact with other races are able to adapt on more amicable terms. Even such "friendly" stalkers shun towns and cities, but they have been known to serve in frontier areas as scouts, hunters, mercenaries, or assassins.

Among the sentient humanoids, stalkers are peerless as climbers. Those who live in mountainous areas typically lair high up on cliffs, while forest and jungle-dwelling stalkers bed down in treetop platforms. Some stalkers use this ability to reach the nests of creatures such as wyverns and giant eagles to steal fledglings to raise as mounts. The fearlessness, agility, and patience typical of stalkers makes them particularly well-suited to train and ride such beasts.
