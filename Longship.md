These single-masted ships have elegant curves and other features that give them their speed, fearsome look, and most importantly the strength and flexibility needed for long voyages. A longship’s main method of attack is with small arms distributed to the crew, as the ship itself is typically unarmed. Longships have good speed, average hit points and average Seaworthiness.
