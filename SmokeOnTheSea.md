# Smoke on the Sea

A five-encounter adventure for four 1st-level characters.

## Introduction

The PCs have reliable information about a fabulous treasure hidden on a remote island. Unfortunately, the word is out and a rival band of murder hobos set sail the day before our intrepid heros.

## The Setting

The adventure takes place on a small, nameless tropical island. A line of cliffs rise from the sea on the west coast of the island. Thick jungle covers the slopes of an active volcano on the east side. To the north, a temple to a benevolent goddess stands at the foot of the volcano. A black sand beach on the south side lines the shores of a sheltered lagoon.

## Preliminaries

_Several days after you set out, a watchman on the ship you hired raises another vessel on the same heading but many miles ahead of you. Undoubtedly, it is the rival ship, for who else would be sailing on this course to nowhere. Excited that you are gaining on your rivals, you urge the ship's master to press on with all sail, but when the sun sets below the ocean astern, you seem no closer._

_Early the next morning, before sunrise, the lookout sights a red glow and hears a distant rumble in the dark ahead. Half-an-hour later, huge waves begin to toss your ship even though the skies are clear. The first light of dawn reveals a terrible sight -- a tsunami wave bearing down on your vessel. In a trice, the ship is capsized and its crew and captain are swept overboard._

_Through foresight and almost incredible luck, your party ends up in the ship's longboat, with your equipment securely stowed beneath its benches. Somehow, you manage to keep it afloat in the swells that follow the tsunami. In the red glare of the rising sun, you see a black cloud on the sea. It is  smoke and ash erupting from a volcano that rises on an island ahead of you. As uninviting as it looks, you have no choice but to row for the cliff-lined western shore of the island, as you know it is the only land for a hundred miles or more._

_The cliffs seem to rise directly from the sea, but you make for a small cove at the foot of a waterfall that has carved a rill down to the shore. The waters are murky with sand stirred up by the earthquake that generated the tsunami. You don't see the reef at the mouth of the cove before it tears a long gash in the planking at the keel of the boat. However, your luck holds and you just make it to the beach._
