**Fey Lingerers** are elves who have fallen into unforgivable, irredeemable evil and so have had the life of the Aelvii withdrawn from them. They do not dwell entirely in the mortal world, nor can they journey to Aelvalon. Fey lingerers are weakened by sunlight, so they commonly retreat to the Ethereal during the day.
