# Mounts and Vehicles

**Aerial Saddles.** This saddle straps the rider in to ride an aerial mount. While strapped into an aerial saddle, you cannot be knocked prone, but cannot add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class unless you are proficient in Aerial Mounted Combat.

It takes an Action for the rider to unstrap himself before he can attempt a dismount. While strapped in, the rider must go where the mount goes, and the mount must move with the rider if the rider is forced to move. If the mount is prone, so is the rider.
