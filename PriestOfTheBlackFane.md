**Diabolic Eminence.** As a bonus action, the priest can expend a spell slot to cause its melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If the priest expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

**Abjure Fiend.** As an action, the priest abjures infernal creatures (those with the fiend keyword). Each fiend within 30 feet that can see or hear the priest must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is abjured for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. An abjured creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the priest as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the priest. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

**Dismiss Fiend.** When a fiend fails its saving throw against the priest’s Abjure Fiend feature, the fiend must immediately return to its home plane if its challenge rating is at or below CR 3. If the fiend cannot return to its home plane, it is instantly destroyed on the plane it is currently on.

**Spellcasting.** The priest is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The priest has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): _minor darkness, unholy flame, thaumaturgy_  
1st level (4 slots): _bane, inflict wounds, protection from evil and good_  
2nd level (3 slots): _blindness/deafness, spiritual weapon_  
3rd level (2 slots): _bestow curse, spirit guardians_
