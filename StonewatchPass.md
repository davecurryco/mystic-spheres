# Stonewatch Pass

## Introduction

Stonewatch Pass is an adventure designed for 5-8 characters of levels 10-15. Through their deeds, the characters can influence events that shape the destiny of an important part of the campaign world. Successful completion of the adventure requires that the party make a moral choice whether to aid the interests of evil fey powers in order to protect the halfling homeland.

### Background

For centuries the halflings of the Downshire have lived in peace and security, protected on all sides by barriers natural and supernatural. To the east are the impassable mountains of Rhunnur. To the south are the lands of the Big Folk, who must defend themselves against the incursions of the goblins of Dhoar and in so doing, defend the halfling homeland as well. To the west is the sea, over which lies the isle of Essealonea, seat of their titular monarch, King Allenar. The Elderwood Forest to the north has an ill name it is true, however, the road through the forest to Brynn is long disused and no trouble ever seems to come south of the Bainwithy River. That is, until now.

In recent months, several halflings have vanished on excursions to the hills of Meadfarthing, the northernmost county of the Downshire. Some were herdsmen or woodcutters, but among the missing have been an experienced forester and even an accomplished magician — folk who could be expected to handle trouble. Now, the Roamer caravans have taken to setting armed guards over their herds grazing in the north pastures and drawing their wagons in a defensive circle at night, as their ancestors once did in the unsettled times of the Wandering. Even the Dweller townsfolk in Bourne shudder at tales of strange lights and shadowed figures stalking the hills many miles to the northeast.

### The Slavers

Unknown to the sheltered inhabitants of the Downshire, the cause of their current troubles lies over the mountains of Rhunnur in the slave-markets of Bar-Krorgroshir, as the former frontier town of Delastarion is called by its new, gobliniod inhabitants. Gray dwarves of the Duergar folk have been paying high prices for slaves of all sorts, fueling war among the goblin tribes and spurring bands of orcs to venture west through the mountain passes in search of captives.

One such pack dared even to venture over Stonewatch Pass, Noor-Sithsrar in their tongue, a place of fearsome repute long-shunned by all the monstrous races. After a fortnight's journey that took them through a narrow gap choked at its western end with an eerie petrified forest, the marauders descended into the valley of the Bainwithy River. They followed the river for several more days until one morning just before dawn, their scouts blundered into the campsite of Brendo Mosscrop, a hapless naturalist who had come to the farthest end of the Downshire to gather specimens of rare, wild mushrooms.

Alone and unarmed, poor Brendo became the first of a number of captives, who the orcs at first took to be goblins of some previously unknown, pale-skinned tribe. However, a series of unnecessarily harsh interrogations revealed that the slavers had hit paydirt — an unwarlike country filled with a surprisingly hardy folk of suitable stature to toil alongside the goblins in the mines of the Duergar. The raiders hurried back through the mountains with their prizes. The prices these fetched at market all but guaranteed that the orcs would launch subsequent raids on the simple folk of the Downshire.

### The Stonegarth

In the millennia before the Cataclysm, the elves of Asarial built the great Shield Wall to guard the southern approach to their domains. However, they learned to their sorrow at the Battle of the Black Skies that their enemies had opened a hidden pass through the western mountains, a narrow gap the dwarves called Kher-Khalgashad, “Hammercleft Gap”. Victorious, but chastened, the elves planted a sapling of the great tree Laessedomon at the head of the valley on which the pass opened, thereby establishing a crossing to Faelyon, the Greenwood. The elves gave the primeval forest so created to the Drummonduma, treants, to be their domain so long as they suffered no enemy to pass that way again.  Many a pleasant twilight festival the children of the Illuvarin held beneath lanterns hung from the mighty boughs of the great silver tree at the heart of the forest. For so the sapling of Laessedomon had become, with its roots in the soil of Aelvalon and its branches in the sky of the mortal world.

Long centuries passed and even the realm of Aelvalon changes, however slowly it may be marked in the lands beyond. The borders of Cymmyrion infringed on the region of the Greenwood in which the primeval forest stood. Under the influence of Blightland, the heartwood of the treants grew dark and they came to relish their task as guardians too greatly. After all, had not the houses of the Aelvii warred among themselves on a time, and might they not be still be considered enemies even of one another. As the treants grew jealous and sullen, the elves came to find the forest perilous and eventually shunned it. Yet, a prince of the Illuvarin had granted the land to the Drummonduma for all time. So long as the treats kept to their end of the bargain, which they certainly did, the elves would not be foresworn.

Isolated from light and mirth and standing as they did in soil that had once been touched by the elemental forces of earth, it is little wonder that the hearts of the treants eventually hardened and turned to stone. Indeed, the guardians of the forest became entirely petrified. Although they could no longer stalk intruders and pulp them with an unexpected blow from their enormous fists, the treants no longer needed to. The shadow of Blightland itself became the only weapon necessary to fulfill their oath and the fear they exacted from their occasional victims became the only sustenance their blackened spirits required.

By then, the lands all around had been reshaped by the Cataclysm and the elves, dismayed at the shattering of Asarial, had withdrawn to the remnants of the forest of Iaellon. In a great irony, the dark hatred of the black treants came to shelter the halflings who settled the hills west of the mountains of Rhunnur from the depredations of the monstrous races who overran its eastern slopes. The halfling pioneers who ventured to the head of the Bainwithy River valley named the place The Stonegarth and turned away, never to return.

The petrified treants outlasted even the silver-barked child of Laessedomon, which withered and perished in the midst of the dark, overgrown and unwholesome snarl the forest had become. However, with the death of the great tree, the tear between worlds that had gaped like a suppurated wound gradually closed over and healed to a scar. Cut off from the necrotic energy of Cymmyrion, the undying Drummonduma went to sleep and crushed the souls of the enemies of the Illuvarin only in their brooding dreams. The gnarled oaks and creeping vines of Blightland gave way to a sparser growth of natural fir and clean-limbed pine. Light once again penetrated the leaves of the forest and fell at the roots of the petrified treants, who now stood impotent to bar the way to any save by ancestral dread — and the memories of the goblinoid races are not long.

## Episode 1

### Dark Rumors

The normally complacent halflings of the Downshire are shaken. North of Bourne, villagers lock their doors at night and are even more wary of outsiders than usual. Herders in the Meadlands go in small, armed bands to guard herds of cattle that once a lone herd-boy might have tended. Roamer caravans circle their wagons and set a watch at night. Even as far away as the taverns in Thainholt, talk among the halflings circles back to the mysterious disappearances of recent weeks.

The adventurers notice changes in the behavior and demeanor of the folk of the Downshire. The usually cheerful, open folk have become troubled and suspicious. Rumors abound about murders and disappearances in the northern pasturelands, near the valley of the Bainwithy river. However, there is little the adventurers can learn by interrogating the worthies of village and wagon. Indeed, there is much misinformation afoot. To find out what is really going on, the adventurers will have to find out for themselves.

### The Raiders

If the party follows the trail of rumor to the hills south of the Bainwithy River, they will encounter a large raiding party that has taken a number of captives and is moving them east.

_You see a band of orcs skulking east through the hills. Two large orcs trot along with a pack of six wolves leading the way, followed by a line of over a dozen halflings with gorees (slave-sticks) around their necks. The stumbling, exhausted halflings are lashed along by four orc overseers who nevertheless don’t seem to be in any great hurry themselves. Another eight orcs follow behind, carrying their axes and spears casually on their shoulders._

The raiders are a scouting-party comprised of twelve **orc warriors**, with two **werewolf** scouts, a pack of six **worgs**, and their two **orog** handlers. Their leader, an **orc war chief** named _Lursh_, brought the band west along the Bainwithy valley in the hope of finding settlements. Along the way, the orcs captured sixteen halfling **commoners**, all Roamers, in various small groups. From them, Lursh learned that the valley is uninhabited and that the sizable villages and towns lie to the south. The warlord then turned his band around to get their prizes back to the base camp and set out again in a more profitable direction.

The orcs have developed a contempt for the halflings’ martial abilities and are returning in the direction from which they came so they are moving along rather incautiously. The hapless captives are bound together in a long line and their guards urge them along under the lash, more for sport than from any sense of urgency. Nevertheless, the raiders will fight ferociously to fend off any rescue attempt. Their viciousness and depravity is such that they will kill the captives rather than allow them to be freed.

If the adventurers attack the raiders, the orcs will fight with their customary ferocity. However, they do not have anything at stake that they value more than their lives, so they will flee if over-matched. Any orcs who escape will make straight for the base camp, which may betray its location to pursuers.

### The Base Camp

_You see smoke rising from a bluff above the river and investigate to find an encampment fronted by a ditch and a tall post-and-wattle fence. As you approach, the too-familiar stench of orc-filth assails your nostrils._

The raiders are only a scouting-party for a larger band that has established a camp on a bluff above the river. The camp is a collection of lean-to huts constructed of rudely-hewn branches of ash, oak and willow thatched with pine boughs. It is protected on two sides by the bluff and the orcs have built a wattle fence on a third side and fronted it with a shallow ditch. Orc guards keep watch on the open side.

A large wikiup covered in skins stands roughly in the center of the camp. Immediately outside, a pole bears a standard of deerskin on which is painted a yellow snake’s eye surrounded by red rays, the personal device of _Brugluk_, co-leader with Lursh of the expedition. Near Brugluk’s quarters are several smaller wikiups occupied by his lieutenants. Close by, there is a fenced barracoon which currently holds six halfling commoners that the orcs took as captives. Near this, a makeshift forge belches black smoke and sparks.

There are seventy-two **orc warriors** and four **orogs** busy about the camp preparing for more raids on the halflings. Two **ogres** are along for the really heavy work as well as eighteen **worgs** to serve as trackers (not mounts). Brugluk is an **orog warlord** and his four lieutenants are **orogs** as well. The smith and his six assistants are **goblins** and there are twenty-three other **goblins** who serve in menial occupations such as cooks and porters. All have joined the Brugluk-Lursh expedition for a promised share in the profits from the sale of the slaves they hope to capture and bring to market in _Bar-Krorgroshir_.

Brugluk has sent scouts to explore the territory around the camp. He does not expect attack in such a remote location so the orcs will not be on alert unless they are warned by escapees from the first encounter.

## Episode 2

### The Willow-Maid

_At a slow bend in the river, the leaves of an ancient willow tree droop into the water. It is a place of serene beauty and everything from the gentle breeze stirring the willow branches to the small white flowers that blossom along the riverbank seems in perfect harmony. Near the base of the tree, a stunningly beautiful, slender maiden dressed in a pale green gown stoops to gather rushes, which she reaps with a copper sickle almost the same color as her waist-long, wavy hair. She does not start at your approach, but rather heaps her armful of rushes into a wicker basket at her bare feet and picks it up. She smiles mysteriously, then turns gracefully and without a word, walks away upstream along the river bank._

The maiden is Nesseya, a **naiad** who embodies the spirit of the Bainwithy River. She is aware of all that passes along the river and has oracular powers so she is aware of the party and its mission. She will not speak to the party and they will find that no matter how quickly they follow her, she always stays just out of conversation range, even though she seems to walk at a leisurely pace. If the party does not follow, Nesseya will sing her charm song to lure one or more of the adventurers after her.

If the party is good-aligned and acts accordingly, Nesseya will lead them to the next encounter -- with her husband, Berendil. If he party is evil-aligned or shows ill-will, Nesseya will lead them to a trap:

### The Lady of the Lake

_You follow the maiden along the banks of the river to the shores of a small oxbow lake. Instead of stopping, the maiden simply walks into the shimmering waters of the lake until her head disappears beneath its surface. Shortly thereafter, a woman’s fair arm clad in shimmering samite emerges from the center of the lake, holding aloft a shining longsword. Even at a distance, you can see that its hilt and pommel gleam with platinum and encrusted white gems and its mirror-bright blade bears runes that seem to be etched in pale white fire._

Characters who attempt to approach the sword by flying will find that a hurricane-force wind rises to oppose their movement. Characters who attempt to walk on the water by magical means will find that the surface of the lake gives way beneath their feet and closes above their heads, effectively submerging them. Character who approach within 200 feet of the sword will draw attack from a swarm of ten **water weirds** at Nesseya’s command. The lake is 30 feet deep at its center and Nesseya will simply drop the sword and assume her watery form to escape if her creatures seem to be getting the worst of it.

The sword is a Star Brand, one of a very few forged by dwarven smiths and enchanted by elven magic to imbue their blades with the hard brilliance of the stars. This particular sword captures the light of _Illeyessa_, the brightest star in the constellation _Ancalyemar_, The Crown. It was given to King Faralon I in token of an alliance between the elves of Asarial, the dwarves of Azenendhal, and the men of Essealona against the Azruun Empire. More than a decade after the Cataclysm, Faralon's flagship was wrecked in a storm even as it sought shelter in the harbor at the mouth of the Bainwithy river. Faralon was drowned with his crew, but centuries later his sword was discovered in the ancient wreckage and brought up the river, where it came into Nesseya's possession. Little appreciating its significance, the naiad holds this treasure lightly. She regards it only as a shiny bauble to use as a lure to trap the greedy and she might trade it or give it away on a whim.

### The River Sage

_You follow the maiden along the banks of the river to a spot where it is joined by a tributary stream. She leads you by a path along the stream until you arrive at a forest grove that surrounds a thatch-roof cottage with stone walls. A log bridge spans the stream at this point and the maiden strews the path from the bridge with rushes until she disappears at the door of the cabin._

Shortly thereafter, a tall, muscular man steps onto the threshold from within the cabin. His long, unbound hair is white and his handsome face shows lines of age, but he walks unbowed with a spring in his step. His blue eyes are bright as he greets you with a strong, clear voice saying, “Peace to you, friends, and long life.”

This is Berendil, a human **druid** who Nesseya fell in love with and took to be her lover many centuries ago. Through this union, Berendil is attuned to the river and draws vitality from it. Also, the stream that runs through the grove arises from a spring in the fey realm. Time runs differently along its banks than it does elsewhere in the mortal world. Thus it is that although Berendil is mortal, he and Nesseya have lived together through many centuries of the world outside. In this time, Berendil has grown mighty in his mastery of the powers of nature -- but he can never leave the grove.

Berendil and Nesseya will welcome well-intentioned parties. They will give advice and even gifts to good-aligned characters, depending on the extent to which the adventurers show pure motives, good deeds and courtesy. However, the naiad and her husband know little of the world outside the Bainwithy valley and, if possible, care even less. The adventurers may come to understand this if they accept Berendil’s hospitality and stay as guests at his cottage, because for each day they spend in the grove, 1d4 weeks will pass by in the world outside.

The naiad and her consort can offer the following information to their guests:

The source of the Bainwithy river is Lake Starmere (in elvish, _Filyameren_) in the Moonglow Mountains (_Cantaya Omonhinloth_ as the elves call them, or _Karaden-Dhunzen_ in the tongue of the dwarves), the mountain range at the heart of Rhunnur. To the northeast of the Starmere Basin lies a narrow pass the dwarves name Hammercleft Gap (_Kher-Khalgashad_) beyond which is a valley called Stonewatch Pass (in elvish, _Himloth Tornuniel_). The halfling pioneers named this pass and the valley beyond The Stonegarth, but turned back at its borders and never ventured that way again.

In the wake of this discussion, a song will come to the mind of the party's bard (or other spellcaster if no bard is present), -- not as a creation of his own, but as though dimly remembered from some previous hearing:

> Gaily bedight,  
> A gallant knight,  
> In sunshine and in shadow,  
> Had journeyed long,  
> Singing a song,  
> In search of Eldorado.  
>  
> But he grew old—  
> This knight so bold—  
> And o'er his heart a shadow  
> Fell as he found  
> No spot of ground  
> That looked like Eldorado.  
>  
> And, as his strength  
> Failed him at length,  
> He met a pilgrim shadow—  
> "Shadow," said he,  
> "Where can it be—  
> This land of Eldorado?"  
>  
> "Over the Mountains  
> Of the Moon,  
> Down the Valley of the Shadow,  
> Ride, boldly ride,"  
> The shade replied—  
> "If you seek for Eldorado!"  

### The Trappers

_A small creek that is tributary to the river has been dammed off by beavers. As you circument this obstacle, you notice a rusty iron chain attached to a tree near the water's edge. Following the chain, you find a beaver trap. It is still set._

Two halfling trappers (scouts), Ezron Rushbriar and Sanfern Hillthrush, are hiding in the brush at the forest's edge nearby the pond. They are watching the adventurers closely. If they feel that the party is threatening in any way, they will continue to hide, but if not, they will announce themselves after several minutes.

Ezron is the older of the two and has black, curly hair with more than a little gray in it. He wears mutton-chop sideburns and his chin even sports a faint growth of beard. Sanfern is young, barely out of his tweens, and is tall and slender for a halfling. His mane of sandy-brown hair stands in wooly disarray. Both wear high-waisted trousers of deerskin and thick flannel shirts with leather waistcoats and overcoats. Also unusual for halflings is that both men wear thick-soled boots.

The two are Dwellers who spend their summers trapping beaver to sell in the markets of Bourne. This year, the disruption caused by a series of orc raiding-parties passing through has forced Ezron and Sanfern to stay well into autumn to collect enough pelts to make the trip worthwhile. As is their usual practice, they are currently building a raft to float their goods downriver. In exchange for food, drink, smoke, and a little company, they will be happy to tell the adventurers what they have observed of the raiding parties.

### The Watchtower

_Above you, on a spur of a mountain overlooking the head of the Bainwithy valley, you see the tall spire of a solitary tower. As you approach, you can see that the tower is built of expertly-cut stone following a sophisticated architecture, but has long since been abandoned. The base of the tower actually stands on a promontory that extends into a dark tarn at the foot of the mountain. There is a single entrance to the tower that can only be reached by an elegant, but crumbling, arched bridge connecting to the mountain spur._

The tarn is the abode of a kraken that will rise from its depths to attack creatures who attempt to cross the bridge.

Inside the tower, a solitary staircase of stone winds past the beam supports of floors that collapsed long ago. However, the top floor is sound and in its west wall is an intact window with diamond-shaped panes of clear crystal set into an elegant arch that looks over the Bainwithy River valley. The floor is constructed of a bronze framework inset with polished stone tiles in an intricate pattern. In the center of the room stands a pedestal of pale blue marble that evidently once held a shallow bowl or basin, but is now empty. The window is magical and acts as a scrying device that can show any place or creature within five miles of the river anywhere along the length of the valley.

The tower was built by the elves of Asarial to be a watchtower over the Bainwithy valley and Hammercleft Gap. It was abandoned after the fall of Asarial and fell into decay.

### Hammercleft Gap

_Above the watchtower, a crumbling, ancient track leads up the side of the mountain and plunges through a narrow, high-walled wind gap between two peaks. In places, the track climbs high above the floor of the gap and winds around ledges that cling precariously to the mountainside. You are traversing one such spot in single file when you spot a large flying creature in the distance. As you watch, the creature dives down into the gap and then climbs rapidly above it. At the top of its climb, the creature stretches its bat-like wings, wheels around and swoops again. As it does so, you see that the creature has a rider -- a humanoid who seems to be wielding a bow._

The creature is a **wyvern** ridden by a stalker named Rakkari, who is the leader of a band of mercenaries who have established a checkpoint in the pass. The group, which includes two **ogres**, their two **orog** handlers, ten **hobgoblins** and eighteen **goblins**, is holding an ambush point against a body of thirty-two **orcs** and fifty-six **goblins** led by eight **duergar**. Rakkari has just demanded a toll from the larger party, which is traveling west through the pass in order to join the hunt for halfling slaves. The mercenary punctuated her dropped message by puncturing a hapless goblin bearer with an arrow. She intends to land on a cliff-ledge above the scene to gauge the slavers' response. The ogres stand ready to lever boulders down on the other party and the hobgoblins crouch in hiding with arrows nocked to the strings of their longbows to fire a volley on Rakkari's command.

The adventurers can turn this tense situation any number of ways to their advantage or detriment. Rakkari's mercenaries and the slavers are focused on each other. Neither expects intervention from the west and so both are vulnerable to being surprised from that direction. It is even possible that the mercenaries and the slavers might join forces if they perceive the adventurers to be a greater threat.  It is more likely, however, that the two sides will act separately, each in its own defense. Rakkari in particular has no loyalty to the gang of ruffians she leads and will readily desert them if any fighting turns against their side.

## Episode 3

### Stonewatch Forest

_At the opposite end of the watchtower tarn, you see a forest of tall, leafless trees at an elevation well above tree-line. When you journey to the edge of the forest, the reason becomes clear. From their gnarled roots, to the tips of their bare branches, the huge trees are solid rock in variegated shades of brown red, yellow and black. You pass scores of them as you travel. Some lie in pieces on the ground, but most stand upright. They might be statues of trees, but certainly no mortal sculptor has ever had such skill. Although the monoliths are much weathered, the detail of their rugged bark and twisted limbs is stunning. You can even count the rings on the trunks of the fallen trees. The only thing that suggests that the trees might have been produced by an artist is the fanciful suggestion of human characteristics — boles resembling grotesque faces, gnarled roots that grip the ground like toes of enormous feet, and branches that seem to end in splayed fingers are common among the stone trees. Many of them even inset agates that look like perpetually glaring eyes. Perhaps it is this that gives you a feeling of unease in this place — as if something is watching you and is not at all pleased with what it sees._

Illuvarin lore masters know this place as _Himloth Tornuniel_, Stonewatch Pass. The halflings named it The Stonegarth, for they felt the hostility of the Drummonduma and turned back, but none of that folk have ventured near its borders for many generations. The stone treants that once guarded the pass are now asleep, waiting for the dark energy of Cymmyrion to infuse the soil once again.

There are 623 petrified treants scattered over several hundred acres. Were they awake, nothing could move through the pass without their leave — which they would be unlikely to grant to any but a high-ranking Illuvarin or a power of the Dark Fey.

### The Crossing Grove

_As you venture into the deepest parts of the petrified forest, you find a place that must once have been a sacred grove. Atop a hillock stands a circle of ancient stone columns, some of which are still capped with the remants of elegant arches decorated with unmistakably elven motifs. At the center of the circle is a low circular stone wall some three feet high and thirty feet across. The wall surrounds a dead tree, bare of twig, leaf, and bark but still standing upright. The wood of the tree is a pale, bleached silver and it must once have been very large and shady._

At the heart of Stonewatch Forest is _Cael Celadrin_, the Crossing Grove, where the elves of Asarial planted a sapling of the great tree Laessedomon to link that place to the plane of Aelvalon. As the sapling grew into a great silver tree, the life energies of the Feywild spread out in all directions and permeated the area. The Illuvarin used this ambient power to awaken the oldest and largest trees of the forest, thus creating the Drummonduma, the treants, to be the guardians of the pass. The Illuvarin named the sapling _Yalessevaelo_, the Tree of Awakening, and surrounded it with a colonnade of marble pillars surmounted by graceful arches carved to resemble the branches of trees. The elves honored the place as a sacred grove until the coming of the blight of Cymmyrion. When it became clear that no remedy could restore the grove to a place of light without killing the sacred tree, the Illuvarin shunned it.

After the Tree of Awakening died and the petrified treants went to sleep, the ambient connection to the sphere of Aelvalon remained. Even today it is present as a portal between the mortal world and Faelyon. A creature who circles the wall around the dead Tree of Awakening three times in a clockwise direction will be transported to an identical grove in the Aelvalon realm of Cymmyrion -- except that in the land of the dark fey, the colonnade and wall stand untouched by time. The Tree of Awakening, however, still stands dead and dry at the center of all.

Under normal circumstances, the adventurers will first arrive at the Crossing Grove without any idea as to its significance or the presence of the portal. This information might be discovered by magical means while at the site, but the most likely way the characters will learn about them will be through subsequent encounters.

### The Citadel of the Remnant

So that they might never again be surprised by an assault from the west, the elves of Asarial set the treants to guard the mouth of Hammercleft Pass. To keep watch over the treants, the elves built a high citadel and gave it to the stewardship of a prominent noble family, the _Merowyn_. Little did the elven king suspect that the new lords and ladies of the citadel were high in the ranks of the Dharovin of Arestor faction.

At the time they rode into the citadel at the head of their investment procession, the Merowyn had already gone far down the path of darkness. In their new fastness removed from the courts of Asarial, they went farther still. They made pacts with demon princes and entered foul conspiracies with powers of the dark fey. In furtherance of these schemes, their lord Finyelorin enlisted his entire court to perform unspeakable rituals to bring the blight of Cymmyrion to the fey crossing at the heart of the Forest of Guard in which the Tree of Awakening was rooted.

In exchange, Gothrog the Tyrant gave Finyelorin The Eye of Shadow, a gem mined in the caverns of the Underdark by deep gnomes and imbued with dark, fomorian sorcery. With it, the lord of the Merowyn sought to usurp the rule of Asarial by treason.

By the time Finyelorin’s treachery became manifest, the sway of Blightland was too established to be reversed without destroying the sacred tree. The elf-lords of Asarial could do nothing about the influence of Cymmyrion at their doorsteps, but they came in wrath and might against the Merowyn. The Eye of Shadow shattered in Finyelorin's final, desperate defense and he and the members of his inner court were cast down and brought to justice. Their wickedness in life was punished by an unprecedented doom -- withdrawal of the Grace of the Aelvii, by which the elves pass into the Blessed Realm.

Faded from the mortal world, but unable to enter the Blessed Realm, the spirits of Finyelorin and his court still haunt the ruins as fey lingerers and ghosts. By day they are invisible and powerless, but on the first night of each new moon, Darkmoon Manor and its inhabitants appear under the starlight in the spectral trappings of their former glory. The spirits are unalterably bound to their doom. They cannot venture farther than 10 miles from the Manor on either the material or the Ethereal planes. If destroyed, they will reform at full strength on the night of the next full moon.

### Darkmoon Manor

_On a hilltop at the foot of a mountain overlooking the pass stand ruins of what once must have been a fair, if secluded manor. Piles of moss-grown white stones and weathered segments of marble columns mark where the manor's walls and towers once stood. The hilltop is overgrown with weeds and twisted, lightning-scarred cedar trees. A stone-lined pool before the tumbled-down gate is green with algae and choked with rushes. There is no sign of life anywhere, except for the magpies that flit like ghosts in and out among the stones and stunted brush._

The ruins are those of an ancient manor of the dark elves, once known as Darkmoon Manor, Dergaromonanye in their tongue.

There are seven **fey lingerers** who haunt the ruins, attended by ghostly guardians and servitors. Chief among the lingerers are Finyelorin, the lord of the manor, Caelyelonnya, his lady, and Malyenwe, his counselor. Finyelorin's two liegemen, Naraglarin and Daedrannor, do his bidding. Caelyelonnya's ladies-in-waiting, Neleayonna and Adraeyesse, still serve their mistress. All are bound to a single fate.

The ruins are forsaken and forbidding. Wild animals and even birds shun the area, except for a breed of magpie  that the dark Aelvii once tamed as spies and messengers. The lingerers lost their ability to command the magpies, and Druids of the Order of the Briar have coopted the birds to keep an eye on the area.

However, on the first night of the new moon, the manor appears as it did at the height of Finyelorin's power. Since the adventurers are unlikely to arrive at the right time, they can gather clues to the timing of the manor’s appearance from encounters.

### The Hunt

_At night, you hear the distant sound of silver horns. They draw closer, and you hear the stamp of horses' hooves and the shouts and laughter of their riders. Suddenly, a unicorn dashes across a stream and disappears into the woods beyond. In a short space, a pack of six displacer beasts pursues it, followed closely by four elves mounted on nightmares. On their heels follows a group of ghostly, armored elven warriors riding spectral steeds._

The riders are Finyelorin, a **fey lingerer lord**; Malyenwe, a **fey lingerer incanter**; and Naraglarin, and Daedrannor, two **fey lingerers**. The pack consists of six **displacer beasts** and the huntsmen are six **ghosts**, the spirits of elven warriors. The unicorn they pursue will make for the Crossing Grove whence it came, but it has enough of a lead that the riders will not be able to catch it before they reach the limits of their territory. The hunters will be engaged in their pursuit and will ignore the party unless the adventurers interpose themselves. Finyelorin will be furious if anyone interferes with the hunt and will order his followers to attack the party if they intervene.

If the adventurers follow the **unicorn**, they may uncover the secret of the Crossing Grove by observing the creature gallop clockwise around the Circle of the Tree three times, fading noticeably with each each revolution.

### The Ladies' Ride

_At twilight, you hear the sound of small silver bells. Pressing forward to investigate, you see a procession of female elves riding sidesaddle on white stags led by footmen who hold lanterns that light the path ahead with a cool, bluish radiance. The ladies' raiment is of a pale, shimmering silver-blue, and their faces and hair are covered by scarves of pale grey gossamer that glints as with silver. The ladies ride at a slow walk, their heads bowed._

The procession consists of Caelyelonnya, a **fey lingerer lady**, and her companions, two **fey lingerer** handmaidens. The procession is a mummery of their mistress's desire to ride to the sea and depart. The footmen are six **ghosts** of elven warriors. The lingerers are wrapped up in their somber ceremony and will ignore the party unless they are directly confronted.

If the adventurers impose themselves in a respectful manner, Lady Caelyelonnya's servitors will answer for her, saying, “Our lady is she who walks in sorrow beneath the moonlight because she yearns to depart over the sea. Pity her, stranger. No home has she save the Manor, and that only when the new moon rises in the night sky to limn its rooftops."

If the party persists, the Lady will answer them herself in understandable, if archaic, Common. Her spirit is obsessed with yearning for release to the Blessed Realm and her speech is more than half a monologue to herself. She will begin the conversation reasonably enough, but as it progresses, she may turn hostile if the adventurers persist in questions that bring up the contrast between their mortal vitality and her own restless undeath. The Lady may reveal one or more tidbits of information, depending on her disposition:

_**Friendly**_

* "_My father's household kept such as thee as servants. One, our gardener, was a friend of my childhood. He has gone to dust, but I would be kind to thee for his sake."_
* _"We live in the Manor of Darkmoon. Many ages in the reckoning of your kind have we dwelt there."_
* _"I wait upon my Lord and he will not depart until the Way he has opened is once again closed."_

_**Neutral**_

* _"This World is a weariness. Rejoice that you walk in it for but a little time."_
* _"Yours is the blindness of those newly-born. Kinder is the pillow that smothers than the breast that nourishes to the babe who will but wisen to sorrow."_
* _"We awoke thy race (meaning halflings) as a simple folk to serve us in simple things. Just so did we awake this other's folk (meaning dwarves) so that they might build and craft for us. Others we awoke to bloodshed so they might serve us in war. If we sinned in the one deed, so have we sinned in the others. Mayhaps we should amend our fault?"_

_**Hostile**_

* _"Is it right that you walk in song and feast in merriment, while we your masters trudge beneath the yoke of long years and taste but the dust of centuries when we sup?"_
* _"Our arts awoke your race to life. How is it that you have stolen away with life's sweetness? Myself, I am left only the bitter dregs and perforce must drain the cup to the last drop!"_
* _"Traitors and thieves! Know our despair and make trial of whether you can bear it!"_

If the party sufficiently annoys the lady, the spirits will attack, seeking to drown the adventurer's life energy in the dark well of their despair.

### The Lord's Court

If the adventurers visit the ruins of the manor on the night of the new moon, they will see a different sight:

_Where once only tumbled-down stones overgrown with creepers and bracken stood, now rise high, crenelated walls and lofty marble spires roofed in tiles of pale celedon. The windows of the towers are lit and everything is illuminated by a cool, bluish-white radiance. Through the elaborately-wrought silver gates, you can see water playing in a courtyard fountain and black swans floating elegantly in the still water of the pool that surrounds it. The gates are open wide and seem to be unguarded._

If the party ventures inside, they will find Finyelorin holding court with Caelyelonnya and their entire retinue:

_An elven lord sits on his high seat in the courtyard with his lady. His knights stand by to attend while two ladies in waiting play an intricate duet on the wire-strung harp and wooden flute. A counselor stands before them and addresses them formally in elvish as if giving a report of some kind._

The counselor is Malyenwe. If the party has means to overhear him when they first arrive and can understand the archaic Elvish he speaks, they will hear him say, "As you know well my lord, the shards have long been hidden from our sight. Yet the portents are clear. This very night a part of that which we seek draws nigh - indeed within our very grasp."

If the adventurers come to the attention of Lord Finyelorin and his court, Malyenwe will recognize from his "portents" that they bear a shard of the Eye of Shadow. He will quietly advise, again in Elvish, "My Lord, it would be wise to treat with these folk. They bear only part of our need, but that mayhaps could stand in earnest token of the rest." Unless immediate hostilities break out, Finyelorin will address the party in archaic Common and attempt to negotiate. However, the lingerer lord's envy of the living, scorn for the servant races, and barely-contained hatred of dwarves may get the better of his advisor's counsel.

_**Friendly**_

* _"My house has ever dealt fairly with thy folk and I would deal fairly with thee. What manner of precious goods do you bear? It may be that you have items that would please my lady and lessen the burden of her solitude with their novelty. If so, I would buy them of you."_
* _"Many of the world's goods we have no need of, it is true. Yet, there are some treasures that may yet delight even such as we."_
* _"Things that are fleeting, even as you are, we have little regard for. Yet, the jewels of the earth endure, even beyond the measure of the Illuvarin."_
* _"The common baubles that may be mined beneath these mountains we have in great store. More do we treasure the rare and exotic gems of the south, which come but seldom to our lands. Black opal, in particular, would I have and would pay thee twice its cost in the cities of the dwarves or humans for its rarity."_

_**Neutral**_

* _"There was a time not long since, meseems, that your folk rendered up that which was required, received their due recompense, and counted themselves generously rewarded. Should I bargain with thee as with a fishwife? Tell me plainly, what goods have you? You will not be the worse for it."_
* _"Think not that because we do not draw breath as you do that we are therefore wan and powerless. The fathers of your fathers' fathers served us and we treasure the work of their hands even now while they are dust. Yet, albeit we may outlast the centuries, our patience with thee is not boundless."_

_**Hostile**_

* _"Wretched mortals! Ingrates! You have forgotten your place! Know now the wrath of your masters!"_

If the party antagonizes Finyelorin, he and his entire retinue will attack. On the other hand, if the adventurers successfully navigate the elven lord's moods and sell him a piece of black opal from the Eye of Shadow (for which he will indeed pay twice the usual price in gold coins of antique Illuvarin mintage), the lord will challenge them with a quest.

The lingerers' treasure-hoard is hidden in a suite of chambers buried beneath the ruins of the tower. Only Finyelorin may access it. If the party completely vanquishes the lord and his retinue, they may excavate the ruins to find the entrance to the chambers.

### The Quest for the Sapling

Finyelorin, lord of Darkmoon Manor, bids you listen to his story:

"Many centuries ago by the reckoning of your kind, this citadel stood guard over the only western approach to the ancient kingdom of elvenkind on earth -- Asarial. I and my folk kept watch here against the coming of our enemies. Yet, not by the keen blades and bitter spears of our warriors alone were our lands defended. The lords of Aelvalon vouchsafed to us a seedling of Laessaedomon, the Great Tree, which we planted in the sacred grove at the heart of the forest in the valley below. It is said, 'Where grow the children of the Firstroot, there is the domain of Aelvalon,' and by its power we awakened the very trees of the forest and charged them to be wardens of the pass. The place where the tree stood, we named the Crossing Grove, for there one could cross freely between this world and the realm of Aelvalon."

"The lands about we named The Forest of Guard and even after the Kingdom of Asarial fell, an age and more agone, the trees faithfully kept their watch. Yet, it is long since the Drummonduma were the doorwards of the elves, for the lords of the Illuvarin cower in the forest of Iaellon, many days journey to the northeast. Rather, the Forest of Guard has kept safe the lands of thy folk in all the long years of thy fathers, though they knew it not. For the watchers would no more suffer goblins and their ilk to pass west through the mountains than east."

"'The Stonegarth', thy ancestors named the pass in their ignorance, and shunned it, though by it were they hedged from fell creatures that would have made their blood run cold. And still may, for the Tree of Awakening, long though its life had been, withered and died at last. The thin veil between worlds became once again a wall and the Drummonduma, their roots no longer nourished by the soil of Elfland, fell back into slumber. The savage races soon forgot their fear of the Forest of Guard, for the memories of their kind are short. They have now ventured through the pass and they have found that the lands beyond are filled with fat, timid folk -- an flock unguarded, bare to pillage and slaughter."

"Goblins and orcs multiply in the mountains and they will spill into your lands like spring floods in the canyons. Fouler creatures too will swell their flow, for slaves are in great demand at the auctions in Delastarion. My folk cannot now contest their passage, for we are faded, as you see. Puissant as thou mayest be, I deem that thy might will not suffice to dam the flood. Yet, do not despair, for still may we aid thee and thus fulfill our charge. When the Tree of Awakening first began to wither, we sought for another seed of the Great Tree to set in its place against the day when it should fail. At length, we found that for which we sought, but the seedling was stolen from us even as it took root in the Crossing Grove. We know the thief and whence she took the sapling, but we cannot pursue, for we have not now the power. Recover the sapling and with it we can once more awaken the guardians of the pass."

If the party accepts Finyelorin's quest, he will share the following further information, which he gleaned himself or gathered from the fey grapevine:

* The sapling tree was stolen by a female human warlock of the Ancient Order of the Briar, who reached the Crossing Grove with the aid of two rangers from the Telenar colonies.
* Alone, the warlock confronted the guardians that Finyelorin had placed at the Crossing Grove, defeated them, and then uprooted the seedling with skill, apparently intending to preserve it rather than destroy it.
* The three escaped down the Talonnin River in a magical boat.
* By his arcane arts, Finyelorin located the seedling. It was planted in a forest east of Tyrneon, a city in Essealona, where it grew to a sapling. The fey crossing to the Greenwood Realm thus created is small and lies in a hidden spot, but it has reportedly been the site of at least one incursion by humans into the fey realm.
* Although the Crossing Grove is a crossing no more, a residual effect is that a portal to the realm of Cymmyrion remains. To cross, one needs merely circle the wall surrounding the dead tree three times clockwise. To return, one circles the wall on the Cymmyrion side counter-clockwise.

Everything Finyelorin says here is true, but there is much that he will not tell. Of the blight of Cymmyrion that turned the Drummonduma to creatures of stone, with hearts to match, he will not speak. Neither will he mention his own part in the matter or the doom that fell on him and his folk as a result. Astute players may pick up on clues as to the true character of the lord and lady and their retainers, for example, the fact that they were hunting a unicorn or the condescension with which they address others. If the characters press Finyelorin or Caelyelonnya on the matter, they will dissemble and attempt to change the subject. Malyenwe will use _zone of deception_ to shelter himself and his lieges from attempts to discern more than they are willing to disclose.

Finyelorin is banned from Aelvalon and knows little or nothing of events there. He knows Tyriana of old, but does not that she too seeks the restoration of the fey crossing to Blightland, although for different purposes.

### Return to the Crossing Grove (1)

When the party returns to the Crossing Grove, they will find that it has changed.

_You return to the ruins at the grove that Finyelorin referred to as “The Crossing Grove.” He could have meant no other place, but something is wrong. A thick hedge of thorns has grown up around the colonnade, blocking all access to the court of the Tree within._

The hedge is a _wall of thorns_ cast as a ritual so it will last for one day, has a spell save DC of 16 and is treated as though it was cast from a 6th level spell slot. The wall was placed there by agents of the Order of the Briar, who believe that the adventurers are on a quest to rescue King Allenar. However, the wall was not intended to keep the party out so much as to keep guardian monsters in.

Once inside the thorns, the adventurers will find more changes:

_Inside the hedge, the ruins are shrouded in a thick mist. The piles of rubble, broken columns, and weathered statues that litter the place are hidden unless you are quite close and you must walk carefully to avoid stumbling. Past the colonnade, the twisted shape of the dead Tree of Awakening looms up out of the fog. As you approach, some of the lower branches sway. Too late you realize that the bulk of an enormous creature lies at the roots of the tree, while its five snakelike heads, each at the end of a long, sinuous neck, bare mouthfuls of sharp fangs and hiss at you._

The creature is a **hydra** from the swamps of Blightland, trapped on this side of the portal by the agents of the Order. The Court of the Tree has also become the lair of a **medusa**, to whom Tyriana promised victims and treasure if she would establish residence there. The fog is due to a Control Weather spell also cast by a druid of the Briar. It heavily obscures the entire area. If the medusa is alerted to the party's presence by their attempts to breach the wall of thorns, she will stalk the party by sound as they traverse the ruins, hoping to pick off a straggler once the hydra attacks. Otherwise, she will join the fracas 1d4 rounds after it begins, approaching by stealth from behind.

### Return to the Crossing Grove (2)

If the party is repulsed on their first attempt to cross into Cymmyrion, the Order of the Briar will take more permanent measures to secure the Crossing Grove from intrusions. If the party returns a second time, they will find that the area seems very different. The country for a mile around is overgrown with a dense thicket of black evergreen trees of enormous size that weren’t there before. This is the effect of a mirage arcane spell centered on the Grove. A faint, narrow path winds through the forest. Creatures may only travel along the path in single file. If the characters venture off the path, they will find themselves in difficult terrain and must make a DC 16 Survival (Wisdom) saving throw every five rounds or become confused for 1d4 rounds.

The thicket conceals 20 **giant spiders**, 6 **phase spiders**, and two **arachnaeds** in spider form. The monsters wait in ambush, concealed in the undergrowth or among the branches of the black evergreen trees.
