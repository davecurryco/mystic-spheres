# Simplified Nautical Rules

## Vehicles

### Statistics

In general, the statistics for a vehicle are the same as those given in the 5e rules, with the following special considerations:

#### Type

**Waterborne** vehicles travel through water, usually on its surface.

##### Tags

Additional type categorization is provided by tags. For example, a diving bell has the type _waterborne vehicle (submersible)_.

#### Armor Class

A waterborne vehicle may have additional Armor Class (AC) values for attacks targeted at parts other than its main hull. For example, a sailing ship's Armor Class is 15/13, indicating that attacks against the ship's rigging are made against AC 13, while attacks against its main hull are made against AC 15.

#### Damage Threshold

The Damage Threshold rating of a vehicle assumes Average Construction. As with Armor Class, a waterborne vehicle may have separate Damage Threshold values for its main hull and other components such as its rigging.

#### Speed

A waterborne vehicle's minimum speed is 5 ft. per round unless it has stopped completely. The vehicle's manuver rating for each mode of propulsion is specified in parenthesis. 

#### Maneuver Rating

A vehicle's Maneuver rating consists of four values: Turn, Turn in Place, Maximum Turn, and Reverse.

Waterborne vehicles under sail cannot move backward.  

##### Turn

This is how much the vehicle can turn for each 5 ft. of movement.  

##### Turn in Place

The number of degrees a vehicle can turn in place (turn without moving) for each 5 ft. of movement it sacrifices.

##### Maximum Turn

This is the maximum amount a vehicle can turn in any one round of movement.

##### Reverse

The amount of movement a vehicle sacrifices to move backward.

#### Travel

A vehicle's Travel is its average hourly rate of travel at normal pace, assuming the vehicle is in Average Condition and is operated by a crew of Average Proficiency.

### Traits

#### Beam

The width of the vehicle at its broadest point.

#### Draft

Draft is the depth of a waterborne vehicle’s hull below the waterline. A waterborne vehicle’s draft determines the minimum depth of water it can sail in (Draft + 1 ft.).

#### Masts

The number of masts a sail-powered waterborne vehicle carries. An (s) indicates that the mast can be unstepped.

#### Seaworthiness

A waterborne vehicle's Seaworthiness is used as a modifier to Seaworthiness checks.

#### Crew

The minimum number of skilled crew members necessary to operate the vehicle at full efficiency. Below this minimum, a vessel's Maneuver drops by one level for each 25% reduction. An oared vessel also loses Speed and Travel in proportion to the reduction.

## Naval Combat

Combat between waterborne vehicles follows much the same rules as regular combat, with the vehicles being treated as combatants. Naval combat rules are extended or amended as follows.

A vehicle's **captain** is the creature in overall command of the vehicle. The **helmsman** is the creature in control of the vehicle's movement. A **gunner** is in control of the vehicle's attacks with fixed armament. A **bosun** is in charge of the vehicle's attacks with ranged melee weapons. A creature may act in multiple roles, especially on smaller vehicles.

### The Order of Combat

#### Initiative

A vehicle's place in the initiative order is determined by a Wisdom or Charisma check made by the vehicle's captain. It is the captain's choice which ability to use.

#### A Vehicle's Turn

On its turn, a vehicle can **move** a distance up to its speed and can **take one action**, provided that sufficient crew are available for both. 

### Movement and Position

A vehicle moves according to the regular rules, with the following special cases.

#### Difficult Terrain

Each foot of movement that a vessel under sail moves into the wind at its closest point of sail (close reach or close hauled) costs 1 extra foot of movement. Likewise, each foot of movement that a vessel of any type moves against a strong current costs 1 extra foot of movement. Heavy seas also count as difficult terrain. These penalties to movement are cumulative so that a sailing ship sailing at close reach against a strong current in heavy seas would spend 4 feet of movement for each foot it moves.

#### Movement Into the Wind

A vessel under sail may not move directly into the wind. A vessel may only sail to windward if it has the **Close Reach** or **Close Hauled** attribute.

#### Tactical Maneuvers

During its movement, a vessel may make one of the tactical maneuvers described here. 

##### Broadside

A broadside involves sailing a course directly parallel to the opposing ship (traveling either in the same direction or in the opposite direction). This maneuver is so that, as the attacking ship comes alongside the enemy, it can fire all of the weapons mounted on one side of the ship at nearly point blank range.

Initiating a broadside requires no skill check. A broadside maneuver is a move action, and does not include any attacks.

##### Close

The attacking ship maneuvers in close enough to allow troops to board the enemy. In order to initiate a close maneuver, a ship must have enough movement remaining in the round to move adjacent to the enemy’s ship and be able to turn onto a parallel course. If these prerequisites are met, the helmsman can attempt to close. Closing requires a Profession (sailor) check at DC 20.

Success indicates that the ship has pulled alongside the enemy, avoiding the hazards associated with close sailing, and is now within 10 feet of the enemy ship. Each round, the helmsman matches the enemy’s speed and maneuvers automatically (within the limits of his ship’s capabilities, of course) unless the enemy successfully performs an Evade maneuver (detailed below).

Failing the close check by a margin of 4 or less indicates that the helmsman failed to initiate the maneuver correctly; the ship suffers all the normal risks of close sailing. If the check is failed by a margin of 5 or more, however, the ships strike as if the helmsman had initiated a ram maneuver.

##### Evade

When an enemy ship has closed, the helmsman can attempt an evade maneuver to break away from the enemy. An evade maneuver requires a Profession (sailor) check with a DC equal to the result of the Profession (sailor) check that initiated the Close maneuver.

A success indicates that the ship has broken away successfully. The helmsman can then immediately use the rest of the vessel's move action to maneuver away from the enemy ship. A failed check by a margin of 4 or less indicates that the helmsman merely failed to break away from the enemy. If the check is failed by 5 or more, however, the helmsman has “zigged when he should have zagged” and collided with the enemy ship. Treat this as a ram maneuver that only deals 1/2 normal damage, since the ships merely sideswipe instead of colliding head-on.

##### Fend Off

The fend off maneuver is used once an enemy ship has closed with and grappled the ship. The helmsman can not only attempt to jostle the enemy’s boarding hooks loose, but he can make it risky for an enemy crew to attempt to board.

A fend off maneuver requires a Profession (sailor) check with a DC of 15 + 2 for every three boarding hooks set. Success indicates that the helmsman dislodged 1d3 of the enemy’s boarding hooks +1d3 for every 5 points by which the he beat the DC. Any enemy attempting to board when the fend off maneuver is executed suffers a +2 modifier to the DC of whatever skill check is required to board (Jump checks for characters leaping aboard, Balance checks for those using boarding planks).

##### Out Boats

A desperate maneuver used by sail-powered ships in calm winds, outing boats involves putting two or more of the ship’s launches in the water and using them to tow the ship. If two launches are used to tow the ship, they can move the ship at a speed of 5 feet. Four launches can move the ship at a speed of 10 feet, and eight launches can move it at a speed of 15 feet. In all cases, the ship’s maneuverability is Clumsy while using this maneuver.

While movement under tow is part of the vessel's movement, putting the lauches out to begin with requires an action.

##### Overrun

Provided a ship has moved at least 10 feet during the last round, it can attempt to overrun another ship. This is an opposed check using the ship’s Seaworthiness to calculate a bonus as though it were Strength. On a success, the attacking ship moves through the space of the other ship, which loses its next movement. On a failure, the attacking ship stops and loses its next movement. Regardless of the outcome, both ships take damage equal to half the damage they would have taken in a ram (see below).

##### Rake

A rake works like a broadside maneuver, except that the ship sails perpendicular to the enemy, firing across its bow or stern. Rakes are safer than broadsides because most ships have much less weapon coverage to fore and aft than they do from port to starboard. A stern rake also has a major advantage in that the captain’s traditional place on a ship is the quarterdeck at the stern of the ship. Skilled archers in a stern rake can often incapacitate or even kill the captain, which can severely hamper the crew’s morale and fighting spirit. While bow rakes are less likely to kill a senior officer, they still have the advantage of avoiding most of the enemy’s firepower.

Using the rake maneuver is a move action, and does not include any attacks.

##### Ram

To initiate a ram, the helmsman needs only to contact the enemy ship with his own ship. When the ships collide, the attacking ship makes a ram attack as described in the vessel's description.

A ram is initated as part of the vessel's movement, but the ram attack itself is an action.

##### Reef the Sails

Reefing the Sail” entails partially furling the sails to gain maneuverability in close combat at the cost of speed. A ship with reefed sails loses 10 feet of its speed (to a minimum speed of 5 feet), but its maneuverability increases by one category.

A ship’s maneuverability rating can go no higher than “good,” even with reefed sails. A ship with Good maneuverability and reefed sails gains no bonus to maneuverability, but still loses 10 feet of its sail speed.

Reefing the sails is performed as a change sail action.

##### Tacking

A vessel that attempts to sail directly into the wind "luffs" (stops moving) and loses the rest of its movement for the round. The next round, the helmsman may use 10 feet of movement to turn the ship up to 45°, allowing it to move again.

Ships wishing to sail upwind must use a tactic called “tacking”. Tacking requires taking a zigzag course as close to directly into the wind as possible. A proa-rigged outrigger "shunts" while tacking (the bow becomes the stern and vice-versa). Tacking requires the helmsman make a Profession (sailor) check DC 10. On a failure, the ship luffs as described above.

### Actions in Naval Combat

When a vessel takes actions on its turn, it can take one of the actions described here or one of the action options described in its stats block.

#### Board

In order to board an opposing ship, the helmsman must first close with it or ram it. Once two ships are within boarding range (10 feet), creatures can either attempt to leap from one ship to the other with a successful Strength(Athletics) check (DC 10) or by laying boarding planks across the gap.

Ships two or more size categories apart are assumed to have sufficiently disparate deck heights that characters cannot use boarding planks or jump from the lower ship to the higher ship. However, those on the lower ship may use grappling hooks to attempt to climb on board (a ranged attack against AC 10 to secure the grapple, followed by a Strength(Athletics) or Dexterity(Acrobatics) check with a DC of 10).

A boarding plank is simply a large board, approximately 15 feet long and 3 feet wide. At least one character is required to hold the boarding plank in place, and up to three people can hold one plank. Enemies can attempt to dislodge boarding planks by winning an opposed Strength check against the character(s) securing the plank. Crossing the boarding plank requires a Dexterity(Acrobatics) check (DC 12).

Characters can also attempt to board by swinging from the rigging of one ship onto the other. This requires at least a Strength(Athletics) or Dexterity(Acrobatics) check of DC 15. On a failure, the character must succeed on a Strength(Athletics) check at DC 10 or fall (either into the water, or onto the deck of one of the ships). Success on the second check indicates that the character manages to safely swing back to the rigging of the original ship.

#### Change Sail

The captain can direct the crew to change sail by one level as an action.

#### Extinguish Fire

Fire deals damage as usual for the source of the fire, except that ships do not get a Dexterity save to avoid damage. However, a vessel's hull has resist fire (divide the damage dealt by 2 before applying the damage threshold) the first round and each subsequent round. The rigging may also have resist fire if the crew wet the sails (see below). The fire continues until it is extinguished.

A fire can be extinguished by covering the area with water, sand, wet tarps and so on. A character needs 2 gallons of water or sand (or a wet tarp of appropriate size), as well as a Dexterity check (DC 12) to extinguish a single 5-foot section of hull or rigging.

#### Grapple

After a successful close maneuver, a captain can order the crew to set boarding hooks and effectively grapple the enemy’s ship (grapnels or boarding hooks are considered standard equipment for any ship intending to engage in combat). At least three members of the crew must make successful attack rolls against at least three separate sections of an enemy ship’s hull (normally, when a boarding action is imminent, crewmen ready actions to set grapples). If successful, the enemy vessel is ensnared and unable to break away until its helmsman can successfully initiate a fend off maneuver and dislodge all the hooks. Grapple maneuvers are usually employed immediately before boarding.

#### Put Out Boats

A ship may put out one or more of the ship’s launches into the water as an action.

#### Wet the Sails

Wetting the sails is a standard practice before going into battle. Crewmen dump buckets of seawater on the sails, thoroughly soaking them. While this adversely affects the sails’ ability to catch the wind, it makes them much more resistant to fire attacks. Wetting the sails reduces a ship’s speed by 5 ft., but it grants the rigging resistance to fire. The ship must take this action for 10 consecutive rounds for wetting the sails to have effect, and the effects last for one hour.
