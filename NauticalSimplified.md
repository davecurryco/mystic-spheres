# Simplified Nautical Rules

## Vehicles

### Statistics

In general, the statistics for a vehicle are the same as those given in the 5e rules, with the following special considerations:

#### Type

**Waterborne** vehicles travel through water, usually on its surface.

##### Tags

Additional type categorization is provided by tags. For example, a diving bell has the type _waterborne vehicle (submersible)_.

#### Armor Class

A waterborne vehicle may have additional Armor Class (AC) values for attacks targeted at parts other than its main hull. For example, a sailing ship's Armor Class is 15/13, indicating that attacks against the ship's rigging are made against AC 13, while attacks against its main hull are made against AC 15.

#### Damage Threshold

The Damage Threshold rating of a vehicle assumes Average Construction. As with Armor Class, a waterborne vehicle may have separate Damage Threshold values for its main hull and other components such as its rigging.

#### Speed

A waterborne vehicle's minimum speed is 5 ft. per round unless it has stopped completely. The vehicle's manuver rating for each mode of propulsion is specified in parenthesis. 

#### Maneuver Rating

A vehicle's Maneuver rating consists of four values: Turn, Turn in Place, Maximum Turn, and Reverse.

Waterborne vehicles under sail cannot move backward.  

##### Turn

This is how much the vehicle can turn for each 5 ft. of movement.  

##### Turn in Place

The number of degrees a vehicle can turn in place (turn without moving) for each 5 ft. of movement it sacrifices.

##### Maximum Turn

This is the maximum amount a vehicle can turn in any one round of movement.

##### Reverse

The amount of movement a vehicle sacrifices to move backward.

#### Travel

A vehicle's Travel is its average hourly rate of travel at normal pace, assuming the vehicle is in Average Condition and is operated by a crew of Average Proficiency.

### Traits

#### Beam

The width of the vehicle at its broadest point.

#### Draft

Draft is the depth of a waterborne vehicle’s hull below the waterline. A waterborne vehicle’s draft determines the minimum depth of water it can sail in (Draft + 1 ft.).

#### Masts

The number of masts a sail-powered waterborne vehicle carries. An (s) indicates that the mast can be unstepped.

#### Seaworthiness

A waterborne vehicle's Seaworthiness is used as a modifier to Seaworthiness checks.

#### Crew

The minimum number of skilled crew members necessary to operate the vehicle at full efficiency. Below this minimum, a vessel's Maneuver drops by one level for each 25% reduction. An oared vessel also loses Speed and Travel in proportion to the reduction.
