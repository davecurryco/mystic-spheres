# The Ghost Mine

## Introduction

In the mountains east of Badrahar, two prospectors, brothers named Aroor and Bu'jy, discovered a long-abandoned silver mine. Finding a vein of silver ore that had not been played out, the pair staked a claim and began to excavate. At first, things went well and the brothers even hired workers from town to help them. Then strange things started happening. Miners started hearing tapping sounds coming from tunnels that no one was working. Bizarre accidents, some of them fatal, began to plague the site. Petty disputes among the workers flared into violence, occasionally with fatal results. The mine gained an ill name and before long, the brothers were forced to work their claim by themselves, since they could not find anyone willing to hire on.

After no one had seen Aroor or Bu'jy in town for many months, the Miner's Guild factor, An'na baz Shima, sent some of her hired hands to check on them. They found the brother's camp abandoned with all of its equipment and supplies intact, save those that wild animals had spoiled. Inside the mine, the searchers found the rotted corpses of Aroor and Bu'jy sprawled on the dark-stained floor of the mine office -- still grappling each other with the wicked curved knives of the mountain-folk in their right hands. Appalled at this scene of mutual fratricide, An'na's hirelings buried the bodies, boarded up the mine entrance, salvaged what they could from the camp, and returned to Badrahar.

Out of pity for the brothers' widows, An'na bought the claim to the mine when no one else would. She curses her own soft-heartedness though, as a visit to the mine convinced her that the place is both cursed and worthless. However, An'na suspects that the adventurers murdered Yasreena and has decided that the mine would be a fitting end for them. Accordingly, she will offer to deed half of the claim to the adventurers if they will rid it of the curse. To whet their interest, she will show them a silver nugget that she will claim (falsely) that Aroor gave to her to assay.

An'na does not know that the mine was originally excavated by dwarves, who discovered an ancient Dharovin compound inside and came to ruin exploring it. Nor did the dwarves even guess of the cause of their downfall -- an aboleth laired in a subterranean lake beneath the compound. The mine was lost for hundreds of years, but was re-discovered by Aroor and Bu'jy. After the brothers met their tragic end, a band of goblins rifled their abandoned campsite and found the mine entrance. The goblins have learned to avoid the hazards of the place and have scarcely even noticed the dissention and strife, since this is pretty much normal for them. However, they carry their personal treasure and melee weapons with them at all times, not knowing when they might have to fight or flee for their lives.

## The Mine

_Map:_ [Ghost Mine Map](GhostMineMap.pdf)

The mine has been excavated from the hard basalt of a mountainside. Accordingly, the tunnels are narrow and low -- 5'x5' in most places. The tunnels generally follow veins of silver ore, but are interrupted in places by natural caverns, one of which is very large. The influence of the aboleth causes the rock surfaces of the tunnels and chambers of the mine to be wet and slimy. The Dharovin compound (areas S-GG) is not affected by this.

### A) The Mine Entrance

Typical boarded-up mine entrance at the top of a pile of tailings.

### B) Entrance Tunnel

This tunnel curls around to the west following a vein of ore. At its midpoint, a natural cavern opens on the wall to the north.

The tunnel runs 50 feet from the entrance to a 15 foot long section that widens to 10 feet. Just after this section, 15 feet before the door to the Mine Office, the tunnel narrows to a little over 3 feet wide. The ceiling of this wide section is unstable. The dwarves shored it up with rough timbers, but these have deteriorated over time. Aroor and Bu'jy did not have enough mining experience to recognize the danger. The goblins did, but decided to make it a feature. They drove spikes into the vertical supports, six inches above the floor. Their plan was that goblins fleeing the mines could attach ropes to the spikes and collapse the tunnel so as to cut off pursuit. For this purpose, the goblins keep two 50-foot coils of hemp rope carefully hidden beneath a pile of rubble along the east wall near the middle of the collapsing section. A successful DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check will discover the rope.

##### Collapsing Roof
_Mechanical trap_

Three shores support an unstable roof in this 15 foot section of the tunnel. If a rope is attached to the spikes driven in the vertical timbers of the shores, a successful DC 15 Strength check will pull out the timber. When both vertical timbers of a shore are removed, the shore will collapse. Once all three shores are removed, the tunnel roof will collapse. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the area is filled with rubble and becomes impassable.

### C) Mine Office

The wooden door to this chamber is old and a little decaed from the damp. Its hinges are rusted. Even though the door is unlocked, it will take a DC 13 Strength check to open it.

The chamber was cut from the stone by expert hands -- the walls and corners are straight and true, the floor is tiled with square stone flags, and the ceiling is slightly arched and supportd by thick beams of wood. However, the walls are damp and the plaster that once covered them has peeled off in most places. A dark stain covers a good part of the floor next to the smashed and decayed remains of a rough wooden table. Cressets of rusted iron hang on the walls, but they do not hold any lanterns. 

### D) Strong-Room

A rusty iron-plated door stands open at the entrance to this chamber. Its construction is much like that of the office. In a corner is a rusted iron strong-box, but the hasps hang without padlocks and it is empty.

### E) Storage Chamber

This natural chamber at the end of a tunnel was used for storage. It still contains six empty oak barrels and the remains of a dozen pine crates. Although the barrels are in better shape than the crates, their wood is black with decay, their hoops are rusty, and their lids are missing. Among the litter of the crates are a few broken chain-links, several iron nails, and a broken pick-head, all covered in rust.

### F) Secret Stairs

This passage could be called a chute, so steep is its descent from the passage above. The secret doors on either end require a DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check to find from the outside.

### G) Landing Chamber

The Entrance Tunnel intersects with this large natural chamber. The chamber ceiling is 15 feet above the level of the tunnel and the chamber floor is 20 feet below the level of the tunnel. Consequently, the floor of the tunnel forms a sheer ledge overlooking the chamber.

A wooden ladder -- old and discolored, but more-or-less sound, leans against the wall of the ledge. The ladder is trapped in that a rope is tied at the bottom of one of its legs - Wisdom(Perception) DC 15 to notice. The rope leads down to the bottom of the stairs west of the chamber, where three **goblins** wait for someone to try to descend the ladder. When this happens, they will grab their end of the rope and run with it into the passage to the Central Cavern. This will pull the ladder out from under the hapless target, who must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A successful saving throw indicates that the target manages to cling to the ledge and may attempt to climb back up on the target's next turn. A failure indicates that the target falls 20 feet and, in addition to the usual consequences of a fall, must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or drop anything it is holding. A dropped lantern has an 80% chance of going out and a dropped torch has a 10% chance of going out. Immediately after the rope team does their bit, six more **goblins** will charge to the top of the stairs, shoot arrows at the target, and retreat to take their places with the others behind the barricade in the Central Cavern.

### H) Central Cavern

The ceiling of this large natural cavern rises 20 feet above the floor.

If they survive, the three **goblins** from the Landing Chamber rope team will station themselves behind the projecting section of wall to the east of the entrance passage, ready to spring a trap on pursuers. The six **goblins** from the Landing Chamber hit-and-run team will station themselves behind a barricade of old timbers and other oddiments set 60 feet from the elbow in the passage to the Landing Chamber. They will shoot their bows at anyone who rounds the bend and will signal the goblins at the trap when a target is at the mouth of the passage.

When they are signaled, the goblins behind the projection will pull a rope that releases a spiked wooden deadfall grate that is hinged above the doorway. Any creatures in the doorway when the deadfall swings down must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d4 of piercing damage and 1d6 of bludgeoning damage and is knocked back into the passageway. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and can choose whether to end up in the passageway or in the cavern. After it swings down, the deadfall grate will lock into place in a frame of rough timbers set on either side of the mouth of the passageway, effectively forming a portcullis. The portcullis has AC 15 and 27 (5d10) hit points.

Once they spring their trap, the goblins will hurl clay pots full of green slime at the area in front of the portcullis and will run north to release the cave bear from its cage if necessary. Each pot will cover a 5' x 5' area with **green slime**.

#### I) Porch Shelf

In the southwest corner of the Central Cavern, a shelf 20 feet deep is raised 15 feet above floor level. A pair of doors are set into the north face of the shelf. The doors are set side-by-side in archways 10 feet high flanked by narrow, fluted columns. Doors, arches, and columns all seem to have been  carved in place from the dark basalt of the cavern. Each door is decorated with a delicate curvilinear pattern of silver inlay, but is otherwise featureless, with no handle, pull, or knob.

The doors are protected by an improved _arcane lock_. In addition to the usual effects of _arcane lock_, this permanent enchantment is a 5th level spell and adds a damage threshold of 5 to the door it protects. The doors will open by themselves if touched by a creature of Dharovin descent.

The goblins use the ledge above the entry as a lookout. They have secured a rough hemp rope in the northwest corner of the ledge. Bedding of skins laid atop piles of rushes and moss and other detritus litters the area. The goblins also keep shortbows, flint-headed javelins, and clay pots full of **green slime** on hand to discourage intruders. At least one **goblin** is stationed here at all times and he may be joined by others who flee from the Landing Chamber.

_Treasure:_ 4 x Shortbow (fair condition); 31 x Arrow (fair condition); 6 x Javelin (poor quality); 4 x Green slime (in clay pots)

#### J) New Tunnel

The floor drops 10 feet to the opening of a tunnel that was excavated by Aroor and Bu'jy, who were following a vein of silver. The tunnel slopes gradually downward so that at its furthest extent it is 20 feet below the level of the Central Chamber. It was this excavation that brought about the brother's doom. An air of unease lingers in this tunnel and the goblins shun it.

The tunnel is the haunt of 6 **will o' wisps** -- the spirits of Dharovin who died in misery as slaves to the aboleth. Their pale light will be visible in the darkness just beyond lantern-light. They will retreat before anyone who advances down the tunnel, attempting to lure victims to the pocket of poison gas at the end.

##### Poison Gas
_Mechanical hazard_

Creatures that must breathe who enter the final 30 feet of this tunnel must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be affected as by the _confusion_ spell -- except that the saves are against Constitution and an Effect roll of 9 is treated as: "The creature falls unconscious until the start of its next turn".

#### K) Rubble-Filled Chasm

This chasm in the floor has been used to dump mine tailings. It is filled to within 15 feet of the top. 

#### L) Residence Hall

The dwarves started to build a residence hall in this section of the mine, but the floor in the northwest corner collapsed as the miners excavated space for a chamber due to the floor having been undermined by an underground stream. The gap is 5 feet deep and the rubble at its bottom is perpetually wet from water seepage.

#### M) Cave Bear Cage

The dwarves excavated this square chamber and fitted it with an iron portcullis. They intended this to serve as a strong-room to store rich ore, but the goblins have repurposed it as a cage for their guardian cave bear. If the fight in the Central Cavern is going against the goblins, the goblin boss will open the cage and set the bear on the intruders, even if a few of his miners will end up in the way. 

The goblin boss also keeps a rusty iron strongbox in this room. As he is the bear's trainer, he is the only goblin among the miners who can access the strongbox with any safety. It is fitted with a rusty iron padlock of crude construction (DC 10 to open). The goblin boss wears the key on a leather strap around his neck.

_Treasure:_ Silver nuggets (1100 sp), Dwarven coins (30 gp), Azurite (10 gp), Banded agate (10 gp), 2 x Blue quartz (10 gp), Hematite (10 gp), Malachite (10 gp), Moss agate (10 gp), Obsidian (10 gp), Tiger eye (10 gp)

#### N) Break Room

The goblin miners use this chamber to cook and rest between shifts. The north wall is lined with bedding - vermin-ridden furs laid atop piles of moss and leaves. In a corner of the south wall, a cook-fire is laid within ring of stones. The fire has died away to embers, in which several loaves of crude bread have been laid. A few rusty pots stand atop the stones, but they are empty except for black residue at the bottom. Crude graffiti is scrawled on the walls and the ceiling above the fire-ring is black with soot.

There are no goblins in this room, as they are all at work guarding or mining. They carry their melee weapons at all times, but have left their shortbows and arrows in this chamber.

_Treasure:_ 6 x Shortbow (fair condition); 54 x Arrow (fair condition);

#### O) Well Chamber

The dwarves dug a well 15 feet deep in the west wall of this chamber in an attempt to supply fresh water, but to no avail. The influence of the aboleth soon fouled the water. Enemies of the aboleth that drink the water of the well will vomit it out 1d10 rounds later.

#### P) Branching Tunnels

A set of steps roughly carved into the stone lead to a set of four tunnels that branch off a main hall. These were orignally begun by the dwarves and have since been the focus the goblins' efforts. Evidence of their sloppy work is everywhere. Broken and discarded mining tools are scattered in profusion, sections of walls and ceilings are crumbling, and a half-hearted attempt to follow an unproductive vein resulted in a collapsed tunnel in the southwest corner of the main hall. This has resulted in dangerous working conditions.

Six **goblins** and their **goblin boss** are working in the tunnels. At the sound of an alarm or conflict, they will drop their tools and rush to the Central Chamber, pausing to snatch their shortbows and a handful of arrows from the Break Room along the way. It will take them 3 rounds to arrive and this group will have its own initiative in any combat that may be in progress.

_Treasure:_ 6 x Miners's tools (poor condition)

##### Collapsing Roof
_Mechanical hazard_

The use of spells that produce loud sounds or waves of force creates a 10% risk that a random 10' x 10' section of tunnel within 30 feet of the effect will collapse. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.

#### Q) Twin Tunnels

These tunnels were also started by the dwarves, although they stopped excavating when the vein petered out. The goblins have abandoned a rusted-out mining cart in the excavation that joins the two tunnels.

#### R) Forked Tunnel

This tunnel was being actively worked by the dwarves when they were driven out of the mine. In the last-straw incident, a crew was drilling at the back of the eastern branch when it caved in, trapping two miners beneath the rubble. As their cohorts tried to rescue them, two will-o'-wisps appeared, consumed their lives, and drove the rescuers away. Their bones are still visible in the rubble at the end of the tunnel and the spirit of one haunts the area as a **ghost (poltergeist)**.

The poltergeist roams the dungeon making sounds like the tapping of a hammer on stone in order to lure creatures here. If anyone comes to the end of the eastern branch of this tunnel, the poltergeist will suddenly attack. It will pursue intruders as far as the hall between the Break Room and the Well Chamber, but no further.

#### S) Entry Hall

This hall is finished in polished grey stone and floored in black marble. The 12 -foot-high cross-vaulted ceiling is held aloft by slender pillars and arches, also of black stone, inlaid with tracery of silver. At the peak of each vault, a delicate lamp of silver and crystal depends from a silver chain affixed to the ceiling. The architecture continues in the style of the great doors -- graceful, curved lines that meet at sharp angles. Between the pillars, shallow, lancet-arched niches set into the walls are bare except for a row of silver hooks affixed to the wall near the beginning of each arch. The decayed shreds of tapestries hang from some of these.

An archway off the hall near the doors opens on a small, empty guard-chamber. Further down the hall, other archways contain doors sheathed in an unusual hard, dark metal with a slightly purplish cast. This is adamantine steel, which the Dharovin used extensively. The Drow method of forging it uses necrotic energy channeled from the Negative Plane. Items forged of Drow adamantine are diamond-hard, extremely durable, and practically unbreakable, but rust rapidly into uselessness when exposed to sunlight.

The doors at the far south end of the hall are the same size as the doors at the north end, but are wrought from adamantine. They are incised with the same silver filigree borders, but the center panels are occupied with bas-relief figures of Drow warriors -- helmed, cloaked, and resting their hands chest-high on the hilts of gracefully-curved swords. These are **stone watchers**, but their armor class is 20 due to the material of which they are made. The watchers will admit an elf or half-elf of Dharovin ancestry who speaks the password (_laessma_, "leave" or "permission" in the Dharovin tongue). They will bar the way to others. Once the watchers are destroyed, the doors will still be shut by the same improved _arcane lock_ spell that seals the north doors, although their adamantine construction gives them an additional 5 hit point damage threshold (for a total of 10), immunity to damage from non-magical attacks, and resistance to magical cold, fire, force, and lightning damage.

#### T) Spa

A rectangular pool with a carved marble fountain occupies the center of this large chamber. Both are dry. At the north end of the room, a dark marble statue stands on a low dias. The statue is a carving of two elven women dressed in simple, flowing gowns. One of the women turns away with the back of her hand lifted to her forehead in a gesture of sorrow, while the other catches at her trailing hand.

A secret drawer is built into the dias. A successful DC 20 Wisdom(Perception) check will find it, while a successful DC 15 Intelligence(Investigation) check will reveal that it can be opened by means of two hidden latches. The drawer is lined in adamantine and contains several compartments, most of which are filled with dust. However, a black-lacquered wooden box has survived. The box is 24' x 12' x 4' and has a simple clasp and hinges of silver. Inside are compartments that contain three ungent jars filled with _healing salve_ (like a _potion of healing_ except that it is applied to the skin, rather than drunk) and an ivory whip-handle with silver fittings (the leather thongs of the whip have rotted away).

#### U) Massage Room

The door to this room is made of dark wood, heavily laquered and fitted with silver-plated bronze hardware. The lacquer treatment has preserved the wood over the centuries, but it is still quite deteriorated (1/4 normal hit points). It has no lock, but can be latched from the inside. However, it stands slightly open.

The remains of two gilded wooden couches lie on the floor near the middle of this room. A lacquered wooden chest of drawers lies collapsed in ruins at the north end of the room. Two large, but empty, alabaster amphorae in silver stands occupy the south end of the room. Wispy tatters of once rich tapestries hang on silver hooks mounted in the walls. The floor is adorned with an intricate mosaic of ceramic tiles and small squares of black onyx, but it is covered in dust.

_Treasure:_ 2 Alabaster amphorae in silver stands (50 GP)

#### V) Vestibule

This room was once used for residents to shed their outer garments and wash up after trips to the outside. It is now quite empty.

#### W) Greeting Room

This chamber was used to greet guests. The remains of a gilded couch occupy the northeast corner. It is fronted by a black marble table set on an adamantine frame styled in graceful curves. The table-top is decorated with the now-familiar curvilinear motif. A broad, but shallow, niche in the south wall was once adorned with a mural, but only flecks of faded color remain.

#### X) Storage Room

The wooden door of this room is dark-stained, lacquered, and fitted with silvered hinges, pull, and lock. It is in good condition, having been protected by an _arcane lock_ spell. The lock would normally require a successful DC 15 check with thieve's tools to open, but the _arcane lock_ raises this to DC 25. The key is long lost and the _arcane lock_ will not open except for the bearer of the key.

This room was used for storage, but the costly goods once kept here are now fragments and dust that is mingled with mud from seepage under the secret door. For this reason, the secret door is fairly easy to find -- DC 10 Wisdom(Perception), but it still requires a DC 15 Intelligence(Investigation) check to figure out the hidden latch that allows it to be opened.

#### Y) Antechamber

The adamantine-sheathed door to this room is barred from the inside, but the wood of the beam is rotten and will yield to a successful DC 10 Strength check. The room is completely dark and is empty except for two male **drow elite warriors** who stand guard beside each of the doors. Their wills are enslaved by the aboleth and they will immediately attack any non-ally that comes into the room. If they have had any warning, they will have prepared actions triggered by the appearance of an enemy in the doorway: one to cast _faerie fire_ on the first enemy he sees and the other to cast _darkness_ immediately afterward, centered on the door. The two will then retreat behind the door to the Sleeping Chamber to warn their mistress.

This room is affected by a twisting of reality caused by the presence of the aboleth. Creatures looking on the room will perceive it to be as it was centuries ago. The walls will appear to be painted in pastel shades and hung with silken banners. The floors will appear carpeted with richly-woven carpets, also of silk. A creature in the room may make a DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) on its turn. On a successful save, the creature perceives the room as it is -- barren and dingy, but may still physically interact with the illusion, as with _mirage arcane_.

#### Z) Bed Chamber

Both doors of this chamber are sheathed in adamantine, but are normally unlocked (the guards from the Antechamber will bar the door if they retreat behind it). The interior of the chamber is dressed in white marble with black pillars and arches supporting the cross-vaulted ceiling. Elegant lamps of purple crystal suspended from silver chains cast an exotic, dim glow that is reflected in the polished black marble of the floor. A circular dais of white marble occupies the western end of the room. A small, marble-topped table with a graceful adamantine frame stands in the middle of the east wall. Atop it is a silver tray piled with unfamiliar danties, a silver pitcher filled with a clear, but somewhat earthy-tasting, wine, and four silver goblets chased with elegant designs.

Like the Antechamber, this room is covered by a glamor of its past glory. Rich furnishings and decorations seem to cover the bare floors and walls. The dais is graced by a round bed piled with coverlets and cushions of silk and draped with a gauzy silk canopy -- all illusory. Four silver cressets fitted with purple crystals are fitted into the west wall. They illuminate the bed-canopy from behind at different angles, forming confused, but decidedly feminine, silhouettes within.

A **drow priestess**, a female **drow mage**, and two other female **drow** lounge within the room -- all dressed in the flimsiest of silk garments (AC 12) and adorned with ornaments of silver set with precious and semi-precious stones. They too are slaves of the aboleth and will attack intruders on sight, although they are unarmed.

If the drow are taken by surprise (not likely if there is combat in the Antechamber), they will be in the bed together and will be the actual source of the silhouettes. If they have warning, the mage will cast _greater invisibility_ on herself and then use _minor illusion_ to cast similar shadows on the canopy. If she has time, she will cast _mage armor_ on the priestess (AC 15). The other drow will hide behind illusory draperies on the walls. Because they are unarmed, the drow will first use _web_, _darkness_, and _Evard's black tentacles_ to pin down their enemies. If this succeeds, the mage will use _cloudkill_ and the priestess will use _conjure animals_ (2 **giant spiders**) to try to kill them.

#### AA) Boudoir

This chamber, which is also affected by the glamor, looks to be well-appointed with chairs, end-tables and a plush couch, but it is actually bare except for a chest of carved alabaster with legs and fittings of black-enameled, silver-chased adamantine. The chest has three drawers, each of which is locked (DC 18) with a key that the priestess keeps in a locket on her belt. The bottom drawer is additionally protected by a poison-needle trap (DC 18). Each of the three drawers contains a _glyph_ that stores a spell that is triggered when any creature other than the priestess opens it. From top to bottom, the spell glyphs are: _contagion_  (flesh rot), _insect plague_, and _geas_ (seek out a female drow and follow her commands). The top drawer contained goods that have perished, the middle drawer contains magic items, and the bottom drawer contains valuables.

A _quasit_ idles about this room. It is the familiar of the drow mage in the Bed Chamber and will seek to warn her if intruders visit this room before they find the Bed Chamber. If it has warning (for example, if there is combat in the Antechamber) it will already be invisible.

_Treasure:_ Wand of Binding

_Treasure:_ 2800 gp, 140 pp, 2 x Chalcedony (50 gp), Chrysoprase (50 gp), Moonstone (50 gp), Onyx (50 gp), 2 x Quartz (50 gp), 3 x Sardonyx (50 gp), Star rose quartz (50 gp), Zircon (50 gp)

#### BB) Parlor

#### CC) Great Hall

This long hallway has a high cross-vaulted ceiling supported by black marble carytid columns in the shape of female drow cavorting with demons. The figures seem to writhe in the flickering, purplish light shed by the large crystal and silver lamps hung from the ceiling on silver chains. This hall is the very center of the glamor and the illusory carpets, tapestries, and other furnishings seem richer and more luxurious than in any other chamber.

At the far end of the hall, a black marble fountain trickles endlessly. The noisome water in the basin glows with a pale, greenish light. Any creature within 5 feet of the basin must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be compelled to gaze into the water. The aboleth will be aware of creatures so compelled and can use its _probing telepathy_ ability through the water in the basin to gauge their intent.

The door to the Ramp is made of solid adamantine and is locked with an _arcane lock_ subject to the will of the aboleth. The creature may very well allow the adventurers to pass if it thinks that they might make good slaves.

#### DD) Shrine

A smaller chamber with a vaulted roof. At the far end, a triptych of ebony with silver fittings . The central panel depicts a demoness queen attended by other demons, male and female, that spread across .

#### EE) Dining Chamber

#### FF) Storage Chamber

#### GG) Ramp
