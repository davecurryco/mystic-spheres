# The Ghost Mine

Ancient Dharovin compound discovered by dwarven miners.
Aboleth in subterranean lake.

## Introduction

In the mountains east of Badrahar, two prospectors, brothers named Aroor and Bu'jy, discovered a long-abandoned silver mine. Finding a vein of silver ore that had not been played out, the pair staked a claim and began to excavate. At first, things went well and the brothers even hired workers from town to help them. Then strange things started happening. Miners started hearing tapping sounds coming from tunnels that no one was working. Bizarre accidents, some of them fatal, began to plague the site. Petty disputes among the workers flared into violence, occasionally with fatal results. The mine gained an ill name and before long, the brothers were forced to work their claim by themselves, since they could not find anyone willing to hire on.

After no one had seen Aroor or Bu'jy in town for many months, the Miner's Guild factor, An'na baz Shima, sent some of her hired hands to check on them. They found the brother's camp abandoned with all of its equipment and supplies intact, save those that wild animals had spoiled. Inside the mine, the searchers found the rotted corpses of Aroor and Bu'jy sprawled on the dark-stained floor of the mine office -- still grappling each other with the wicked curved knives of the mountain-folk in their right hands. Appalled at this scene of mutual fratricide, An'na's hirelings buried the bodies, boarded up the mine entrance, salvaged what they could from the camp, and returned to Badrahar.

Out of pity for the brothers' widows, An'na bought the claim to the mine when no one else would. She curses her own soft-heartedness though, as a visit to the mine convinced her that the place is both cursed and worthless. However, An'na suspects that the adventurers murdered Yasreena and has decided that the mine would be a fitting end for them. Accordingly, she will offer to deed half of the claim to the adventurers if they will rid it of the curse. To whet their interest, she will show them a silver nugget that she will claim (falsely) that Aroor gave to her to assay.

An'na does not know that the mine was once worked by dwarves, who discovered an ancient Dharovin compound inside and came to ruin exploring it. Nor did the dwarves even guess of the cause of their downfall -- an aboleth laired in a subterranean lake beneath the compound. 

## The Mine

_Map:_ [Ghost Mine Map](GhostMineMap.pdf)

The mine has been excavated from the hard basalt of a mountainside. Accordingly, the tunnels are narrow and low -- 5'x5' in most places. The tunnels generally follow veins of silver ore, but are interrupted in places by natural caverns, one of which is very large. The influence of the aboleth causes the rock surfaces to be wet and slimy, except as noted.

### A) The Mine Entrance

Typical boarded-up mine entrance at the top of a pile of tailings.

### B) Entrance Tunnel

This tunnel curls around to the west following a vein of ore. At its midpoint, a natural cavern opens on the wall to the north. 

### C) Mine Office

The wooden door to this chamber is old and a little decaed from the damp. Its hinges are rusted. Even though the door is unlocked, it will take a DC 13 Strength check to open it.

The chamber was cut from the stone by expert hands -- the walls and corners are straight and true, the floor is tiled with square stone flags, and the ceiling is slightly arched and supportd by thick beams of wood. However, the walls are damp and the plaster that once covered them has peeled off in most places. A dark stain covers a good part of the floor next to the smashed and decayed remains of a rough wooden table. Cressets of rusted iron hang on the walls, but they do not hold any lanterns. 

### D) Strong-Room

A rusty iron-plated door stands open at the entrance to this chamber. Its construction is much like that of the office. In a corner is a rusted iron strong-box, but the hasps hang without padlocks and it is empty.

### E) Storage Chamber

This natural chamber at the end of a tunnel was used for storage. It still contains six empty oak barrels and the remains of a dozen pine crates. Although the barrels are in better shape than the crates, their wood is black with decay, their hoops are rusty, and their lids are missing. Among the litter of the crates are a few broken chain-links, several iron nails, and a broken pick-head, all covered in rust.

### F) Secret Passage

This passage could be called a chute, so steep is its descent from the passage above. The secret doors on either end require a DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check to find from the outside.

### G) Landing Chamber

The Entrance Tunnel intersects with this large natural chamber. The chamber ceiling is 15 feet above the level of the tunnel and the chamber floor is 20 feet below the level of the tunnel. Consequently, the floor of the tunnel forms a sheer ledge overlooking the chamber.

A wooden ladder -- old and discolored, but more-or-less sound, leans against the wall of the ledge. The ladder is trapped in that a rope is tied at the bottom of one of its legs - Wisdom(Perception) DC 15 to notice. The rope leads down to the bottom of the stairs west of the chamber, where three **goblins** wait for someone to try to descend the ladder. When this happens, they will grab their end of the rope and run with it into the passage to the Central Cavern. This will pull the ladder out from under the hapless target, who must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A successful saving throw indicates that the target manages to cling to the ledge and may attempt to climb back up on the target's next turn. A failure indicates that the target falls 20 feet and, in addition to the usual consequences of a fall, must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or drop anything it is holding. A dropped lantern has an 80% chance of going out and a dropped torch has a 10% chance of going out. Immediately after the rope team does their bit, six more **goblins** will charge to the top of the stairs, shoot arrows at the target, and retreat to take their places with the others behind the barricade in the Central Cavern.

### H) Central Cavern

The ceiling of this large natural cavern rises 20 feet above the floor.

If they survive, the three **goblins** from the Landing Chamber rope team will station themselves behind the projecting section of wall to the east of the entrance passage, ready to spring a trap on pursuers. The six **goblins** from the Landing Chamber hit-and-run team will station themselves behind a barricade of old timbers and other oddiments set 60 feet from the elbow in the passage to the Landing Chamber. They will shoot their bows at anyone who rounds the bend and will signal the goblins at the trap when a target is at the mouth of the passage.

When they are signaled, the goblins behind the projection will pull a rope that releases a spiked wooden deadfall grate that is hinged above the doorway. Any creatures in the doorway when the deadfall swings down must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d4 of piercing damage and 1d6 of bludgeoning damage and is knocked back into the passageway. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and can choose whether to end up in the passageway or in the cavern. After it swings down, the deadfall grate will lock into place in a frame of rough timbers set on either side of the mouth of the passageway, effectively forming a portcullis. The portcullis has AC 15 and 27 (5d10) hit points.

Once they spring their trap, the goblins will hurl clay pots full of green slime at the area in front of the portcullis and will run north to release the cave bear from its cage if necessary. Each pot will cover a 5' x 5' area with **green slime**.

#### I) Great Entry

In the southwest corner of the Central Cavern, a shelf 20 feet deep is raised 15 feet above floor level. A pair of doors are set into the north face of the shelf. The doors are set side-by-side in archways 12 feet high flanked by narrow, fluted columns. Doors, arches, and columns all seem to have been  carved in place from the dark basalt of the cavern. Each door is decorated with a delicate curvilinear pattern of silver inlay, but is otherwise featureless, with no handle, pull, or knob.

The doors are protected by an improved _arcane lock_. In addition to the usual effects of _arcane lock_, this permanent enchantment is a 5th level spell and adds a damage threshold of 10 to the door it protects. The doors will open by themselves if touched by a creature of Dharovin descent.

#### J) New Tunnel

The floor drops 10 feet to the opening of a tunnel that was excavated by Aroor and Bu'jy, who were following a vein of silver. The tunnel slopes gradually downward so that at its furthest extent it is 20 feet below the level of the Central Chamber. It was this excavation that brought about the brother's doom. An air of unease lingers in this tunnel and the goblins shun it.

The tunnel is the haunt of 6 _will o' wisps_. Their pale light will be visible in the darkness just beyond lantern-light. They will retreat before anyone who advances down the tunnel, attempting to lure victims to the pocket of poison gas at the end.

_Trap_ Poison gas. Constitution DC 16 or affected as by _confusion_ spell, except that saves are Constitution and 9 is "The creature falls unconscious until the start of its next turn".

#### K) Rubble-Filled Chasm

This chasm in the floor has been used to dump mine tailings. It is filled to within 15 feet of the top. 

#### L) Residence Hall

The dwarves started to build a residence hall in this section of the mine, but the floor in the northwest corner collapsed as the miners excavated space for a chamber due to the floor having been undermined by an underground stream. The gap is 5 feet deep and the rubble at its bottom is perpetually wet from water seepage.

#### M) Cave Bear Cage

The dwarves excavated this square chamber and fitted it with an iron portcullis. They intended this to serve as a strong-room to store rich ore, but the goblins have repurposed it as a cage for their guardian cave bear.
