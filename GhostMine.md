# The Ghost Mine

Ancient Dharovin compound discovered by dwarven miners.
Aboleth in subterranean lake.

## Introduction

In the mountains east of Badrahar, two prospectors, brothers named Aroor and Bu'jy, discovered a long-abandoned silver mine. Finding a vein of silver ore that had not been played out, the pair staked a claim and began to excavate. At first, things went well and the brothers even hired workers from town to help them. Then strange things started happening. Miners started hearing tapping sounds coming from tunnels that no one was working. Bizarre accidents, some of them fatal, began to plague the site. Petty disputes among the workers flared into violence, occasionally with fatal results. The mine gained an ill name and before long, the brothers were forced to work their claim by themselves, since they could not find anyone willing to hire on.

After no one had seen Aroor or Bu'jy in town for many months, the Miner's Guild factor, An'na baz Shima, sent some of her hired hands to check on them. They found the brother's camp abandoned with all of its equipment and supplies intact, save those that wild animals had spoiled. Inside the mine, the searchers found the rotted corpses of Aroor and Bu'jy sprawled on the dark-stained floor of the mine office -- still grappling each other with the wicked curved knives of the mountain-folk in their right hands. Appalled at this scene of mutual fratricide, An'na's hirelings buried the bodies, boarded up the mine entrance, salvaged what they could from the camp, and returned to Badrahar.

Out of pity for the brothers' widows, An'na bought the claim to the mine when no one else would. She curses her own soft-heartedness though, as a visit to the mine convinced her that the place is both cursed and worthless. However, An'na suspects that the adventurers murdered Yasreena and has decided that the mine would be a fitting end for them. Accordingly, she will offer to deed half of the claim to the adventurers if they will rid it of the curse. To whet their interest, she will show them a silver nugget that she will claim (falsely) that Aroor gave to her to assay.

An'na does not know that the mine was once worked by dwarves, who discovered an ancient Dharovin compound inside and came to ruin exploring it. Nor did the dwarves even guess of the cause of their downfall -- an aboleth laired in a subterranean lake beneath the compound. 

## The Mine

_Map:_ [Ghost Mine Map](GhostMineMap.pdf)

The mine has been excavated from the hard basalt of a mountainside. Accordingly, the tunnels are narrow and low -- 5'x5' in most places. The tunnels generally follow veins of silver ore, but are interrupted in places by natural caverns, one of which is very large. The influence of the aboleth causes the rock surfaces to be wet and slimy, except as noted.

### A) The Mine Entrance

Typical boarded-up mine entrance at the top of a pile of tailings.

### B) Entrance Tunnel

This tunnel curls around to the west following a vein of ore. At its midpoint, a natural cavern opens on the wall to the north. A wooden ladder -- old and discolored, but more-or-less sound, leads down a 20-foot drop to the floor below.

### C) Mine Office

The wooden door to this chamber is old and a little decaed from the damp. Its hinges are rusted. Even though the door is unlocked, it will take a DC 13 Strength check to open it.

The chamber was cut from the stone by expert hands -- the walls and corners are straight and true, the floor is tiled with square stone flags, and the ceiling is slightly arched and supportd by thick beams of wood. However, the walls are damp and the plaster that once covered them has peeled off in most places. A dark stain covers a good part of the floor next to the smashed and decayed remains of a rough wooden table. Cressets of rusted iron hang on the walls, but they do not hold any lanterns. 

### D) Strong-Room

A rusty iron-plated door stands open at the entrance to this chamber. Its construction is much like that of the office. In a corner is a rusted iron strong-box, but the hasps hang without padlocks and it is empty.

### E) Storage Chamber

This natural chamber at the end of a tunnel was used for storage. It still contains six empty oak barrels and the remains of a dozen pine crates. Although the barrels are in better shape than the crates, their wood is black with decay, their hoops are rusty, and their lids are missing. Among the litter of the crates are a few broken chain-links, several iron nails, and a broken pick-head, all covered in rust.

### F) Secret Passage

This passage could be called a chute, so steep is its descent from the passage above. The secret doors on either end require a DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check to find from the outside.

### G) Landing Chamber
