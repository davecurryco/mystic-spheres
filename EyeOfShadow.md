# Eye of Shadow

_Wonerous item, artifact (requires attunement)_

The _Eye of Shadow_ was a giant black opal cut from a raw gemstone formed by a crystallized extrusion of the negative energy plane into the material world. From this unique gem, the Aelvii sorceror-tyrant Finyelorin and his counselor Malyenwe enchanted a gem of power capable of summoning and controlling shadow creatures. Finyelorin schemed to conquer Aelvalon and turn it to darkness, but the Illuvarin hero Caerdowyn shattered the gem with a blow of his _Star Brand_. However, the three shards of the gem remained in the world and retained some of their magical potency.

Each of the shards is a 500 GP opal gemstone with its own properties. If rejoined and fused with the proper ritual, the shards have the potential to reform the _Eye of Shadow_ with its original powers.

Each shard requires separate attunement, but all shards attuned to the same creature count as a single magic item. A non-evil creature that attempts to attune to a shard must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) psychic damage, the attunement fails, and the creature automatically fails the saving throw on subsequent attempts.

**_Random Properties._** Each shard of the _Eye of Shadow_ has the following random properties:

1 minor beneficial property (50% chance)
1 minor detrimental property (50% chance)

If the _Eye of Shadow_ is restored, it gains the following additional random properties:

1 major beneficial property
1 major detremental property

**_Properties of the Eye of Shadows_** While you are holding or wearing the restored _Eye of Shadows_, you gain the following benefits:

* You have true sight.
* You can use an action see as if you were using a _ring of X-ray vision_. You can end this effect as a bonus action.
* The gem has 7 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 16) from it: _clairvoyance_ (2 charges), _eyebite_ (4 charges), or _scrying_ (3 charges). The gem regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, you are drawn into the gem as per the _minimus containment_ form of the _imprisonment_ spell. Each time the wand regains charges while you are imprisoned inside, the expended charges reduce your maximium hit point total by 1 point for each charge regained. If your maximum hit point total is reduced to 0 in this way, your soul is destroyed.

**_Shadow Shield_.** While you are holding or wearing one or more shards or the complete Eye, you can use an action to summon shadows to protect you for up to 1 minute. For each shard (the complete Eye counts as 3 shards), 1d4 shadows appear in your space and hide themselves in your shadow. Each time you are targeted by an attack during the spell's duration, you can use your reaction to command one of the shadows to interpose itself and the attack targets the shadow instead. If an attack hits a shadow, the shadow is destroyed unless all damage dealt by the attack is of the necrotic or poison types. The shadows cannot protect you from area effects. If you fail a save against an area effect that deals damage of a type other than necrotic or poison, all remaining shadows are destroyed. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 day.

**_Summon Shadow Horde._** While you are holding or wearing the restored _Eye of Shadow_, you can use an action to summon a horde of shadows to your service. When you do this, 9d6 + 9 shadows and a wight commander appear within 60 feet of you. These undead return to their plane of origin after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. During the spell's duration, the undead obey your commands. If the wight is incapacitated or on another plane of existence, you must maintain concentration or the shadows will immediately return to their plane of origin. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 day.

**_Destroying the Eye of Shadow._** Each shard of the _Eye of Shadow_ has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage except radiant damage. If a shard is destroyed by any means other than by radiant damage, it will reform elsewhere after 7 days. The complete _Eye of Shadow_ has AC 24, 30 hit points, and immunity to all damage except damage from a Star Brand or a similar +3 magic weapon that deals radiant damage. Unless enough damage is dealt to the Eye to destroy it in a single blow, it will shatter into 3 shards, each of which will teleport to a different random location.
