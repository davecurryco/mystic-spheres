# Zerengar Hall

## The Gates

### The Gate Towers

#### Lower and Upper Floors

Staircases to the east and west of the Entryway lead to the gate towers. These are essentially the same -- unadorned chambers occupied only by the supplies necessary to discommode unwelcome visitors (pikes, crossbows, crossbow bolts, oil, and pitch). In the center of the lower floor of each chamber is a wooden staircase that leads to a trapdoor in the ceiling. At each level, this staircase can be withdrawn from above in emergencies. The windows are mere arrow-slits covered by wooden shutters that open to the inside. These are generally closed and secured from within by a latch.

The upper floor of each tower is identical to the lower, except that the arrow-slits are slightly offset from their counterparts below and the trapdoor is offset to the south and leads to the roof. Cases of bolts for the spingalds on the roof are stacked in the corners of each of the upper floor rooms.

A passageway in the northwest corner of the east gate tower leads to a small chamber above the gate itself. The murder-holes in the ceiling of the Entryway have their origins in grates in the floor along the south wall of this chamber. Large cauldrons for boiling pitch/oil stand just behind the grates. Each has a brazier stocked with charcoal beneath it and is mounted on a pivot that makes it easy to tip its contents over into the grates. Barrels of oil and pitch stand ready for use in the northwest corner of the chamber.

#### Roof

The roof of each Gate Tower is plain except for the crenelations on the battlements. On the west side of the east tower and on the east side of the west side are two unusual springalds, on a tilt-mount to permit them to be armed and loaded behind cover and then tilted to fire down into the courtyard . There are piles of stone shot next to each.

### The Battle Gate

From the north end of the Zerengar marketplace, a road paved in stone winds up the side of the cliff called Azhrenkhul (the Sun Cliff). One hundred and fifty feet above the marketplace, _Khzudaran_, the Battle Gate, guards the entrance to Zerengar Hall. The gate-towers are built of blocks of basalt mined from Karad-Zheran itself. Two large iron braziers light the stone-paved courtyard at night and provide heat for the watchmen during the winter.

The gate doors are built of thick oak bound with iron ten feet wide and twelve feet high. In the center of each door is fixed an octagonal iron boss worked with a design of a snarling bear’s head in the geometrical style favored by the dwarves. The gate doors are protected by an iron portcullis. They are also covered by arrow-slits on the first floor of the watchtower fifteen feet above the level of the gate and by murder-holes in the ceiling of the entryway.
The portcullis is normally drawn up during daylight hours and let down at night. Two armed and armored members of the Watch stand guard in front of the gate during the day. They announce visitors by means of ram’s-horn trumpets decorated in silver hung on baldrics at their sides. A third watchman inside opens the door. At night, two watchmen stand guard on the battlements of the watchtowers.

## The Armory Tower

### Lower Floor

The Armory Tower is the main store of armor and weapons for the keep. In racks at the center of the first floor are scores of suits of leather armor with iron helmets and shields of hide-covered oak rimmed and bossed with iron. Racks along the walls hold pikes, axes, hammers and short-swords in similar quantities. Along the staircase on the east wall, which leads to the upper floor, are racks that hold two dozen suits of dwarven-sized chainmail, with helmets and large metal shields.

All windows in the Armory Tower are mere arrow-slits covered by wooden shutters that open to the inside. These are generally closed and secured from within by a latch.

### Upper Floor

The upper floor of the Armory Tower is much the same as the lower floor, except that it is the store for ranged weapons. Cases of crossbow bolts stacked in the center of the room. Several score of crossbows and extra strings are ranged in racks along the walls. There are also several dozen cases of bolts and a chest of tackle for the ballistae on the roof.

### Roof

The roof of the Armory Tower is featureless. Crenelations provide cover for defenders to rain missile fire down on the gate courtyard below. There are also three ballistae in their mounts, on the east, west and south sides of the roof, as a defense against siege engines. There are piles of stone shot next to each. As ariel attack is unheard-of in this time and place, the ballistae are not rigged to target flying creatures.

## The Watch Tower

### First Floor

Stairs lit by lamp-holders fixed at intervals in the walls ascend to the first floor of the watchtower.

The first floor room is undecorated. A fireplace in the northwest corner provides heat and light, but it seldom used. Instead, lamp-holders in the southeast and southwest corners illuminate the room as needed.

Racks on the southwest wall hold three crossbows and several cases of bolts.

A staircase in the north end of the chamber ascends to the second floor.

### Second Floor

This room is part of the keep defenses, but it is normally used to house prisoners. Iron bars define two cells closed by inward-swinging doors also built of iron bars. The south windows are arrow-slits covered by iron bars. These are fitted with outside wooden storm-shutters as well. A fireplace in the northwest corner provides heat and light.

There are no permanent inmates in these cells. The dwarves deal with serious offenses by execution, branding and exile, or forced labor in the mines. The Thain only keeps prisoners here while they are awaiting judgement, which is generally swift. At any given time there is a 10% chance for each cell that it will be occupied. Prisoners are 85% likely to be commoners brought forth for non-violent offences (usually unpaid debts). There is a 10% chance that a prisoner will be a commoner accused of a violent crime and a 5% chance that a prisoner will be exceptional in some way (a non-commoner, a political prisoner, a suspect in an unusual crime).

A staircase in the north end of the chamber ascends to the third floor.

### Third Floor

This room is used by the watchmen when they are are on-duty but off-shift or when the weather is too bitter to stand duty on the roof. It is lit not only by the fireplace in the northwest corner, but by a lamp-fixture made of stag antlers hung from a chain in the center of the ceiling. There is a cot in the northeast corner near the stairs leading to the roof. A circular table and four chairs occupy the southwest corner. A large bearskin hangs on the wall above. Racks in the southeast corner hold four crossbows and several cases of bolts.

To permit observation as well as defense, the windows in this room are a foot wide. They are covered by swinging windows with brass frames set with panes of glass. These latch from the inside and are protected by wooden storm-shutters on the outside. These shutters have a double-leaf design that allows them to be narrowed to arrow-slits as well as to be fully closed.

### Roof

The roof of the Watch Tower is paved with slate flagstone. Crenelations provide cover for the watchmen. Two ballistae stand on the north and south sides of the roof, but their mounts are on wheels that permit them to be moved to cover the entire 360 degrees visible from the roof. There are piles of stone shot next to each ballistae. Like the ballistae on the Armory Tower, these are not rigged to target flying creatures.

A watchman stands here at all hours, except in very inclement weather, when the watchman looks out from the windows on the Third Floor.

## Main Level 1

### The Vestibule

The gate doors open onto a vestibule hewn into the side of the basalt cliff and floored in shale flagstone. The ceiling is fifteen feet high and is supported by four buttresses, one in each corner, that join in an arch. A large iron lamp fixture hangs by a chain in the center of the arch. Large tapestries on the walls between the buttresses and the east and west passageways carry the bear-crests of the four sub-clans, while the two tapestries on the north walls carry the rampant bear design of the Zerenzher clan proper. On the south wall, on either side of the gate passageway, are the mechanisms that lower the portcullis and bar the doors.

In the middle of the north wall, two oak doors four feet wide and ten feet high each lead to the Great Hall. These are normally closed during the day and are barred from within at night or in emergencies. Like the gate doors, they are of stout oak bound with iron. They too have octagonal bosses with a bear design, but these are of silver rather than iron.

Stairs lead up from passageways in the east and west walls. Above the square lintels hang goblin shields, arms and banners -- trophies of Zerenzher victories. At all times during the day, a watchman is present in this room to provide security.

When the Thain’s Meet or Orlanmed is in session, Galron’s Chamberlain, Doran son of Furnir, greets those who have business and announces them to the hall. Doran is older than Galron, and has a beak-like nose and long, pointed eyebrows and mustaches above his grey-streaked black beard. Although he keeps the Thain’s court well-ordered, Doran is not at all officious, but rather tends to be informal and somewhat gruff. He is Galron’s cousin and closest confidant.

### The Great Hall

Like the Entryway, the Great Hall was delved directly into the basalt of the cliff. Its arched roof, twenty feet high, is supported by six columns carved from the living rock. The floors are of polished granite, strewn with thick carpets of goat’s wool decorated in geometric patterns. Banners bearing the crests of the four sub-clans hang between the columns and a large banner carrying the Zerenzher clan crest hangs above the Thain’s Seat at the north end of the Hall. A staircase with a bannister of grey marble is similarly carved into the west wall of the Hall. A guard is stationed at the top of this staircase whenever there is an occasion in the hall.

Tables and benches of stout oak line the walls for feasts. The tables are on hinges so that they can be stowed away against the walls when the hall is in use for business. Another set of tables with integrated benches (rather like a picnic table) stands between the columns at the north end of the room during feats and are stowed away agains the staircase wall when not in use. A large central fireplace lined with granite blocks and fitted with an ornate rack and screen made of iron occupies the center of the hall. Above it, a copper hood channels smoke into a central flue. A fire continually burns here and it is stoked into a cheerful blaze during feasts. Six large lamp fixtures hang from chains in the spaces between the pillars and a pair of iron charcoal braziers stands to either side of the north end of the Hall.

The Thain’s Seat is a dais set in a niche at the north end of the hall. A short set of steps rises three feet above the level of the hall to the floor of the dais. The Thain’s chair is a massive affair of oak with gilded carvings and cushioned with brocaded wool pillows atop a bearskin blanket. A somewhat smaller chair of the same design, but with lambswool in place of the bearskin, stands next to it. During the Thain’s Meet, Galron officiates from the Seat and at feats, his chief wife, Darylaya sits beside him.

Galron is relatively young for a dwarven leader and his curly golden hair and braided beard are as yet untouched by grey. His grey-green eyes glitter with restless ambition. He is affable, but impatient and has little patience for formality. He is accustomed to command and his followers generally carry out his orders unquestioningly.

Darylaya is older than Galron and is stout and matronly. Their arranged marriage helped Galron ascend to chiefhood. She bore Galron a son, Ered, who is now thirty-eight -- still an unbearded youth. She is quite intelligent and calculating behind her piggy black eyes and her shrewed advice has been another crucial factor in Galron’s success. For these reasons, Darylaya is secure in her position, despite the fact that Galron has two younger wives who he loves more. Her greatest concern now is to secure Ered’s position as Galron’s heir over the possible ambitions of his older half-brothers Urin and Gailor.

Branlor son of Hurnin also attends Galron at most functions held in the Hall. He is also older than Galron. His bald pate shines above his bushy eyebrows and grizzled red beard. Branlor is grim, short-spoken and arrogant. His hatred of goblin-kind is intense -- his one true passion is to see them eradicated.

### The Kitchen and Cellars

Directly off of the Great Hall to the east, a complex of chambers is dedicated to the preparation and serving of food and ale in heroic quantities. The main kitchen has a large fireplace and preparation tables. To the east, a smaller room has a well and a grate that drains on the south face of the cliff. A short passage to the north opens on a staircase that leads down into the cellars, which are well-stocked with food and ale.

## Main Level 2

### The Guardroom

This small, unadorned chamber off the hall to the Living Quarters is the station of a watchman whose duty it is to guard the Armory and the Living Quarters.

### The Living Quarters

The hallway to the Living Quarters is interspersed with short stairways. Oak doors with iron hinges and latches open onto the living quarters themselves, which generally consist of a living room and a bedchamber. There are four such chambers on the south branch of the hallway and two on the north branch. These are the personal quarters of Galron’s ranking officials and artisans, such as the Master Assayer and Armorer.

### The Master Assayer’s Workshop

The easternmost door on the northern branch of the Living Quarters hallway is of heavy oak bound in iron. It opens onto the workshop of  Ashken son of Solor, the Master Assayer.

The workshop consists of two chambers separated by a thick wall of stone. The outer chamber contains two desks, one for clerical tasks and the other for the study of maps and surveys. There are bookshelves along the walls crammed with reference books, surveys, maps, and records. The inner chamber contains equipment for testing the purity of metals and ores. This includes small crucibles, beakers of water and oil, graduates and pipettes. The chamber also has a small metals furnace built into the east wall.

### The Armorer’s Forge

Another door of heavy oak bound in iron opens on the Armorer’s Workshop. This is a complex of three chambers separated by thick walls. The two outer chambers contain benches and tools used in fletching, armormaking and swordsmithing. The inner chamber has a large forge along with workbenches, an anvil and barrels filled with oil used in quenching.

### The Guard Chamber

This narrow chamber has a vaulted roof supported by buttresses built into the north and south walls. It is lit and heated by a large iron brazier in the center of the south wall. The floors are finished granite flagstone and the north wall is decorated with tapestries.

Two watchman are stationed here. Their charge is to see that no one enters the Thain’s Quarters without leave and to announce those who have it.

There is an iron-bound oak door in the middle of the west wall that leads to the Watchtower. There are also double doors set into a passageway that opens on the middle of the north wall. These doors are also of oak, bound in iron, but are inlaid with the Zerenzher crest in rare woods and semi-precious stones. They lead to the Great Stairs and its Landing.

## Main Level 3

### The Great Stairs Landing

Since it leads to the Council Chamber, the Great Stairs was built to be impressive. The floor and stairs are sheathed in rose marble and the banisters are made of white marble with handrails of brass. The ceiling is twelve feet high and is supported by buttresses and arches carved from grey marble. At the apex of each arch, a symbolized bear’s head is carved into the keystone. Brass lamp-stands set in niches between the buttresses provide light. These have lead-glass panes and are decorated with semi-precious stones.

A passageway on the north wall of the landing leads to a well-used oak door, which leads to the Guard Barracks. An iron-bound oak door on the north end of the east wall leads to the stairs to the Great Hall. This is barred from the inside except when the staircase is in use for some occasion in the hall, in which case there will be a guard stationed at the top of the stairs.

The west steps lead to a great double-door of oak, bound in iron. This has wrought-iron pulls and can be barred from the inside. The door is carved with dwarf-runes that read, in Dwarvish,
“Wise council given and wise council taken,
The guides of our people in this land forsaken”

### The Guard Barracks

This chamber is well-finished but unadorned. It is the station of the guards when they are on-duty but off-shift. The ceiling is supported by four square columns left when the chamber was hollowed from the basalt. These are finished, but plain except for simple borders at the base and capitals. A fireplace in the north wall provides heat and light. A lamp-fixture of wood with iron fittings hangs from a chain in the center of the ceiling.

There are four beds ranged along the east and south walls. A table near the fireplace is used for meals and games. A barrel of ale stands on a rack in the northwest corner. Near it on the west wall is a long table that is used for meal preparation. At any given time, this will bear several cheeses, a large basket of bread and a roast as well as a tub filled with apples or other fruit in season. A shelf above the table holds the guards’ beer mugs.

A weapons-rack on the west wall to the south of the table holds the guards’ pikes and shields. A great oaken shield covered with boar’s-hide and a huge spiked club crossed with a dwarven pike hang above the fire. These are trophies of a battle that featured an elite ogre. This is draped with a pair of banners displaying the Zerenzher crest and the snarling bear’s head symbol of the guard.

At any given time, this room will be occupied by 2-4 guardsmen unless some emergency has drawn them away. They are at the Thain’s call, whether he is feasting in the Great Hall, holding council in the Council Chamber or alone in his private quarters.

In the north end of the barracks, a steel-clad oak door opens on a staircase leading to the Strong-Room Guard Station. This is always locked and is barred from the inside when there are guards on duty in the station beyond. The door is fitted with a covered peephole through which the guards can communicate with the outside.

### The Council Chamber

This large chamber is the designated meeting-place of the Thain’s Council. Its floors are flagged in grey marble and the roof is supported by buttresses and arches similar to the ones in the Great Stairs Landing.

The furniture is of dark oak, elaborately carved. A large table surrounded by six chairs stands in the main part of the chamber. A seventh chair, large than the others and inlaid with silver and semi-precious stones stands at the head of the table on the west end. A smaller, less elaborate table stands in the north end of the chamber. During council meetings, this is laden with refreshments.

An ornate marble fireplace stands at the south end of the room. The mantlepiece is carved in dwarven runes reading, in Dwarvish:

_“Take thought before you give counsel,_  
_Take counsel before you give battle,_  
_Take battle before you give way.”_  

On the wall of the north end of the chamber, a fresco depicts the dwarven patriarch Darid I, First of the Free Fathers, reaching to catch a sprig of mistletoe dropped from the beak of a raven. According to dwarven legend, this incident occurred before _Barok-Shenardhan_ (Battle of the Bloody Rocks). As Thrar pondered which of two mountain passes would make the best ground for a stand against the goblins, a raven appeared from the clouds and dropped a sprig of mistletoe into his hands. Darid interpreted this as counsel from Thain, God of Battle, that he should defend the higher of the two, Shir-Khelgashak (Knifeslash Pass), since mistletoe always grows on the smaller branches higher up on the tree. His army drove the goblins back with great slaughter. The dwarven saying, _“The raven may drop the sprig, but Darid must catch it,”_ is used to convey the wisdom that good advice is useless unless it is accepted and acted upon.

When the Council is in session, Galron’s most trusted counselor is Helger son of Geren, also called Helger the Halt by his detractors because of his limp, the result of an injury he suffered in a goblin-raid long ago. Helger is the head of the Dheranzar (Grizzly) sub-clan. He is older than all but one of the other chieftains and has seen more battles than any of them. His hair and beard are red-gold, shot through with grey. He observes more than he speaks, but his observations are always pithy and insightful. He is a brilliant and aggressive commander and much of Galron’s success is due to Helger’s leadership in the field against the goblins.

Opposite Helger on most issues is Resek son of Farlon, the youngest and most outspoken of the chieftains. His black hair and beard, piercing blue eyes, thin features, and restless energy mark Resek as someone to watch out for even before his unvarnished ambition becomes apparent, as it is bound to do almost anytime he speaks. In addition to being egotistical, Resek is vain and miserly. Galron knows well that Resek would like nothing better than to be the chieftain of all the clans, but he is obliged to have him on his Council, and even let him have his way from time to time, even if he does not trust him.

A pair of sturdy iron-clad oak doors leads to Galron’s personal quarters. These can be barred from within. They are generally closed, but are only barred in emergencies or when the Thain wants to speak to someone in private and without interruption in the Living Chamber.

### The Living Chamber

This is essentially the Thain’s living room. A large fireplace heats the room and a lamp-fixture made of gilded brass with crystal lamp-chimneys hangs from a chain in the center of the ceiling. The floors are tiled with green marble and strewn with bearskin and wolfskin rugs.

On the wall of the southwest corner, a large woolen tapestry depicts the Battle of Rern-Ghelar (Snake Ridge), a pivotal struggle in Galron’s career. The tapestry shows most of the stages of the battle, from Galron’s decision to invade the Ger-Hezron valley to the rout of the goblin forces. This tapestry is actually magical. It acts as the focus of an Eye of Alarm that covers the entire room. The enchanted Eye is woven into the figure of a trumpeter that will raise its trumpet and sound an alarm if it sees an intruder. The tapestry will consider Galron, members of his family, and his inner circle of advisors, guards and servants as non-intruders. Darylaya wove the tapestry and can add or delete individuals from the list of non-intruders at any time. The Eye of Alarm counts as level 5, so it has a Stealth of 25 to avoid detection and a Perception modifier of +7 to see enemies. It only has Normal vision.

Well-made, but not overly ornate chairs stand by the fireplace and around a circular table of oak in the same style. A serving-board and keg of ale stand in the northwest corner.

The windows are a foot wide and three feet high, they have brass frames and thick lead-glass panes. They latch from the inside. They are protected on the outside by heavy oak shutters that also latch on the inside.

The door to the connecting room is constructed of oak planks bound in iron. It can be barred from the inside, but it is seldom even closed.

### The Connecting Room

This small room serves chiefly as a buffer and connecting space between the Living Chamber and the Thain’s personal chambers. The walls, ceilings and floors are well-finished, but not ornate. The room is lit by lamps in brass lamp-holders along the walls.

Galron’s personal armor and shield hang on a stand in the northeast corner of the room.

In an emergency, one or more guards may be stationed in this room to be at the Thain’s call.

The doors to the Weaving Room and Living Chamber are of oak bound in iron, while the ones to the Study and Bedchamber are of solid steel. The door to the Weaving Room is generally closed and barred from the inside of this chamber except when the room is in use. The door to the Study is also generally closed and barred from the inside of this chamber except when Galron is using the study. The door to the Bedchamber is usually locked except when Galron is asleep, in which case it is usually barred from within.

### The Weaving Room

This small room was designed to be well-lit during the daytime for Darylaya and her maids to use in weaving. The geometric patterns of weaving are the basis for the geometric designs that distinguish dwarven ornamentation of all sorts. Dwarven women excel at this craft to the same extent and for much the same reasons that dwarven men excel at the mechanical arts. Just as dwarven weapons and armor are readily enchanted, the dwarves often wove magic into the threads of their tapestries in the days of their might. Darylaya inherited this talent and acts as a 5th level Cleric for the purpose of enchanting tapestries.

This chamber is well-finished. The ceiling is flat, rather than arched, and the wall has borders of an intricate, geometric design at the top and bottom. The windows are of the same construction as the ones in the Living Area, but are five feet high.

Along the west wall, in front of the window, is a large weaving frame. Many baskets of woolen yarn in various colors are around it. An unfinished tapestry is on the frame. Darylaya intends it to be the focus of a Consecrated Ground ritual, but it is not yet possible to tell what the scene will be. A similar, but smaller frame stands in the northeast corner. It is complete enough to recognize that the finished design will be the Zerenzher bear crest. One of Darylaya’s maids is working on this as she keeps her mistress company while she is weaving. This tapestry is not intended for enchantment. Both frames have accompanying stools, which are of elaborately carved oak.

A portable brazier stands in the middle of the north wall to provide heat.

### The Study

This is Galron’s library and study. It is lit by means of two brass lamp-fixtures on chains evenly spaced on the ceiling and by movable brass lamp-stands. In the northwest corner, a cast bronze charcoal stove of ingenous design provides heat. An ornate, but comfortable-looking chair stands near the hearth of the stove. A well-made and similarly-ornate writing desk and chair occupy the southeast corner of the room. Large bookcases of oak stand in the northeast section of the wall.

Galron uses this room mainly for study and contemplation. He seldom writes anything himself. Instead, he dictates his correspondence to a scribe who sits at the writing desk. For this reason, the writing desk does not hold anything other than normal writing implements (parchment, steel pens, inkwells and so forth).

Galron keeps his important papers in a chest, which is on the floor along the south wall. It’s contents are mostly ledgers and treaties, but it also contains the following items that might be of interest to adventurers:

* Two Ritual Scrolls (Comprehend Language)  
* One Ritual Scroll (Discern Lies)  
* A dungeon map showing Levels 3 and 4 of Sheurazak (Galron might have this copied as a reward for service)  
* A draft of a letter to Rolan son of Zerlar, the Thain of the Dwerazher clan, currently Lord of the Eastern Halls of Shalenharazad, offering to roust the goblins from the Western Halls in exchange for an arranged marriage between Galron’s son, Ered and Rolan’s daugher Dhraughine. Such a match could result in Ered becoming the Lord of Sharenharazad, since Rolan has no sons and Dhraugine is his eldest daughter. Galron has not yet sent this letter, since the matter is still a question of much debate within his council.  

### The Bedchamber

This ornately-decorated room is Galron’s personal bedchamber. The royal bed, an elaborate affair of carved oak covered in woolen blankets and a bearskin, is situated in the middle of the west wall. A fireplace in the south wall provides heat.

Above the ornate mantlepiece is a tapestry that features the rampant bear of the Zerenzher clan, but it rendered in a somewhat more realistic style than the ones in other parts of the Keep. This tapestry is enchanted. Once per encounter, Darylaya or Galron can call forth a Guardian of Faith that takes the form of a radiant bear. It is stronger than the usual 1st level cleric prayer, as it attacks at +6 vs Fortitude and does 2d8+4 radiant damage on a successful hit.

Galron’s personal battle axe and two throwing axes hang in a brass holder on the north wall of the bed-niche (except, of course, if Galron is wearing them). A nightstand bearing a small chest carved of advenurine stands on the south end of the bed-niche. The chest is itself worth 225GP and contains Darylaya’s personal jewelry worth 1,560 GP in total.

In the middle of the north wall stands a wardrobe. This contains several of Darylaya’s gowns and fur cloaks. These are rich and some of them are ornamented with semi-precious stones (a total of 325 GP worth). The back of the wardrobe is a secret door to the Escape Passage

### The Escape Passage

A plain, but well-constructed passageway leads to a spiral staircase that descends to 10 feet below the level of the marketplace. At the bottom of the stairs is a tunnel that extends south until it ends beneath the floor of the storeroom of a stone-mason’s workshop on the north end of the marketplace. This building is owned by the Thain and its tenant knows nothing of the passageway. Because the passage is designed to be used only in dire emergencies, the flagstone that serves as the trapdoor to the tunnel from the storeroom is mortared into the floor. A set of tools in grease-coated wrappings is kept in a chest at the end of the tunnel, along with a wooden ladder treated to prevent decay.

### The Strong-Room Guard Station

Two guards are on duty in this chamber at all times. The chamber is unfurnished to promote alertness. It is lit by brass lamps on the north and west walls. The staircase is designed to emerge in the middle of the room so as to make it easy to defend.

The guards cannot open the door to the strongroom. As noted before, they are under orders not to open the door to the barracks to anyone save Galron or their relief at the end of a shift. The relief guards are supposed to identify themselves by means of a password, but the guards are lax about this, since they are all relatives and are well-known to each other.

The door to the Strong-Room is of solid iron. It is protected by a strong dwarven lock -- to which Galron has the only key. It is also protected by a Crushing Ceiling trap targeting the square just before the door.

### The Strong-Room

This is where the Thain keeps metals bought and sold on the exchange for safekeeping while awaiting trade or transport. Gold does not run like a river through Zerengar Hall as it did in the great dwarven cities of long ago, but Galron generally has a significant amount of bullion under lock and key here at any given time -- enough that the Thain’s Share (10% of each transaction) produces about 20% of his domain’s revenues.

Except in extraordinary circumstances, the strong-room will contain:

* 1d4 locked chests containing 1d4 x 500 GP in gold bullion each  
* 2d6 locked chests containing 1d6 x 100 GP in silver bullion each  
* 3d10 locked chests containing 1d8 x 10 GP in copper bullion each
