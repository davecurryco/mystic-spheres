# Origins of the Races

## Humanoid Races

The Aelvii grew luxuriant over time and created other humanoids, the so-called "servant races", in order to delegate mundane tasks to them. These races were capable of using magic, but only so far as required by the scope of their duties. The Dwarves were builders and craftsmen and the Halflings were personal attendants. As conflict among the Aelvii escalated, some factions created Goblins as guards and soldiers. Eventually, the Aelvii created Humans as servants useful in any of these roles or in a unique role as pleasure slaves.

After the cataclysms of the war among the Aelvii, communities of the servant races were cut off from their masters and from one another. Each of the servant races had its own distinct characteristics according to the role for which it had been bred. Dwarves, who are disposed to carry grudges, rose against the Aelvii in a number of underground cities and palaces. Once liberated, these served as bases where the Dwarves used their skills to preserve the material foundations of civilization. In their pride, both races suppressed the historical origins of their conflict, which became lost in myth.

Halflings benefited from their kinship with the Dwarves, forming symbiotic communities with their former fellows in servitude. This arrangement ensured the survival of the Halflings and produced many aspects of their culture such as their preference for underground dwellings. Ultimately, Halflings left the underground to seek their own way in the world. This began the nomadic phase of Halfling history, the Wandering. The trials of this time in halfling history produced some of the distinct characteristics of their culture, such as their toughness, adaptability, and tendency to opportunistic larceny.

Humans and goblinkind were cast adrift, making their way among ruined cities and areas of wilderness to carve out territories for themselves. Humans did not compete with Dwarves and Halflings for habitat and these races were generally friendly with one another. For this reason, neither race came into conflict with any but the goblins, although humans displayed a tendency toward internal conflict. Some groups of the more benevolent Aelvii even aided certain human settlements, influencing their civilization and culture for the better.

Goblins, on the other hand, fought bitterly with the Dwarves over underground spaces of all kinds, as well as warring with humans over territory above ground. In addition, Goblins exacted a terrible revenge on their former Aelvii masters in a number of places. Since the Aelvii who bred and enslaved Goblins tended to be members of the cruelest of the various Aelvii factions, they met brutal rebellion with equally brutal repression. The visceral hatreds between the Goblins and the other races stem from these events.

The survival pressures produced by their quarrelsome nature combined with a degree of genetic instability to divide the goblin race into subspecies: Hobgoblins, Goblins, and Bugbears. Later attempts to breed more tractable warriors according to rediscovered formula produced the race of Orcs. Only the hobgoblins retained their original intelligence, although they quickly lost the true history of their origins. The other goblin subspecies and the orcs descended into brutishness (a very short fall for the orcs).

During this period, many Illuvarin took residence in the Feywild. The Dharovin, finding their cause to be all but lost, retreated to the Underdark. Unscrupulous Dharovin also brokered deals between certain humans jealous of the longer lifespans of the other races and powers of the Abyss who promised immortality, but delivered the first Undead.

Half-elves are possible because of the genetic affinity incidental to the role of humans as pleasure-slaves of the Aelvii, but these are rare and are considered to be individual mongrels rather than a separate race. No other races can produce mixed-race offspring with each other.

## Monster Races

Even the most intelligent and long-lived of the monster races of the material plane, the Dragons, never achieved a civilization worthy of separate historical consideration. However, the civilizations of some races native to other planes, such as the Illithids (Mind Flayers) or Xuthilli (Beholders), were ancient before the first Aelvii walked under the twilight.
