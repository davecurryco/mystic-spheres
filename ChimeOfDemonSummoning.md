# Chime of Demon

_Wondrous item, rare (bronze or tin), very rare (silver or gold), legendary (mithril)_

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action. In response, a number of demons appear within 60 feet of you. These demons return to their home plane after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. 

Once you use the chime, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. The chime can be used d8 + 2 times. After the last time, it cracks and becomes useless.

Five types of _chime of demon summoning_ are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The chime's type determines the number and type of demon summoned, as well as the requirement for its use. The DM chooses the chime's type or determines it ramdomly.
