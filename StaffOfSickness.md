# Staff of Sickness

_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_

This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff disintegrates into a _stinking cloud_ that lingers for three rounds.

The end of the staff perpetually burns with a sickly green flame that casts dim light in a 5 foot radius. This flame can be used to ignite flammable materials and does an extra 1d3 fire damage when the staff is wielded as a quarterstaff.

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: _blight_ (4 charges), _ray of sickness_ (1 charge).

**Wave of Nausea.** While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 3 charges to cause a burst of nauseating stench in a 30-foot radius centered on a point within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the burst must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated (retching and vomiting) until the end of your next turn and gains 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. You yourself automatically succeed as well.

**Retributive Plague.** When a creature attuned to this staff is reduced to 0 hit points while holding it, the staff explodes, spreading a miasma of disease in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area of effect are exposed to a virulent form of sewer plague that requires DC 15 Constitution saving throws and has an onset time of 1d4 x 10 minutes.
