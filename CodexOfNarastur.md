# Codex of Narastur

_Wondrous item, arifact (requires attunement and sacrifice)_

The _Codex of Narastur_ was a bound volume of manuscript pages containing arcane secrets of great power and great evil. Its pages and cover were burst apart and scattered across the world long ago, but in the centuries since, those learned in the lore of dark magic have sought to find and reassemble them.

In its full form, the _Codex of Narastur_ had 9 manuscript pages made of what appears to be soft vellum, but is actually the belly-skin of a virgin human girl. It was bound with threads and glue made from the hair and tendons of slain human children and enclosed in a cover of red chimera hide with fittings of gold encrusted with blood-red rubies. Each page of the Codex contains arcane lore written in a flowing hand in inks compounded from arcane materials mixed with the lifeblood of young human men sacrificed in their prime.

The manuscripts in the full _Codex of Narastur_ originally consisted of three unique rituals, three unique spells, and three pages of arcane lore -- all irredeemably evil. As useful as its individual pages may be, the Codex gains additional powers as more of it is assembled. Each increment of 3 more pages bound within the cover conveys properties and powers proportional to the total.

A creature must personally sacrifice a virgin human girl and pour her heart's blood over the cover in order to attune to the Codex. If a creature attempts to open the cover without having made this sacrifice, the creature takes 1d6 + 1 necrotic damage for each page bound in the cover and the attempt fails. Once the cover is open, the creature can attune to the Codex.

Whenever a non-evil creature attempts to attune to the _Codex of Narastur_, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes 1d6 + 1 necrotic damage for each page bound in the Codex, is stunned for 1 minute for each page, and the attempt fails. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil. An attuned creature must spend 40 hours reading and studying each 3 page increment of the manuscript pages contained in the Codex to reap the benefits of that increment.

Once a creature attunes to the Codex, that creature may command the cover to open the Codex to a given page or close the Codex if it is open without using an action. A creature attuned to the Codex may add other manuscript pages from the original work, but may not remove pages. Manuscript pages added to the Codex from any other source will be destroyed as soon as the cover of the Codex is closed.

The _Codex of Narastur_ remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the Codex disappears. If you die while attuned to the Codex, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.

**Random Properties.** The first increment of 3 manuscript pages bound together in the cover of the _Codex of Narastur_ confers the pre-determined detrimental property already mentioned above:

_Before you can become attuned to the artifact, you must sacrifice an innocent human female to the artifact._

Also, each increment of 3 manuscript pages confers the following additional random properties:

* 1 minor beneficial property  
* 1 minor detrimental property

When all 21 manuscript pages are bound together in the cover, the codex gains the following random properties:

* 2 major beneficial properties
* 1 major detrimental property

In addition, the complete Codex conveys the following pre-determined detrimental property:

_The artifact houses the bodiless life-force of its creator. Each time you use an action to use one of the artifact's properties, the life-force attempts to enter your body. If you fail a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, it succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM's control until the intruding life force is banished using a greater restoration or similarly powerful spell._

**Adjusted Ability Scores.** For each increment of 3 manuscript pages, after you spend the requisite time reading and studying, one ability score of your choice increases by 1 to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 1 to a minimum of 3. The Codex can't adjust your ability scores again for that increment.

**Mark of Darkness.** After you spend the requisite time reading and studying each increment of 3 manuscript pages, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to evil. The first mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma(Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma(Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures, but you gain no additional advantage from subsequent marks.

**Incite Evil.** While you are attuned to the Codex and holding it, you can use an action to cast _mass suggestion_ once per day for each increment of 3 manuscript pages (save DC 18). Evil-aligned creatures targeted by this spell have disadvantage on the saving throw. The spell's duration is 24 hours for good-aligned creatures, 10 days for neutral-aligned creatures, and 30 days for evil-aligned creatures. If you are attuned to the complete Codex, the durations increase to 10 days, 90 days, and a year and a day, respectively.

**Blasphemous Utterance.** While you hold the Codex and are attuned to it, once per day for each increment of 3 manuscript pages, you can use an action to recite a passage that blasts the sanity of those who hear it. Each time you do this, each non-evil creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. In addition, good-aligned creatures must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

**Destroying the Codex.** Even when removed from the cover, the manuscript pages of the Codex have resist 10 to all damage. The cover and any manuscript page bound within it has resist 20 to all damage. If any one part of the Codex is destroyed, that part will re-appear elsewhere as long as any other part remains. The Codex can only be truly destroyed by reassembling it and burning it in a flame kindled from the self-immolation of a Phoenix.
