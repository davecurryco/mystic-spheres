# Fortress of Azkruthul

An ancient fortress founded by the witch-king Aznadrad, Azkruthul was expanded and improved by a succession of Azruun commanders. The stronghold figured prominently in the campaign against the elves at Asarial. All but the original keep and castle were thrown down in the Cataclysm and the lands surrounding the fortress became a moor haunted by trolls and ogres.

The hag Pentayla, the self-styled Troll Queen, made the ruined fortress her lair. As her schemes to achieve martial and arcane power prospered, she rebuilt and repurposed the fortifications. Under her rulership, the Fortress of Azkruthul is a forbidding stronghold teeming with fell creatures.

## Site

The keep and castle of Azkruthul stand on a sharp promontory overlooking a river that winds through the noisesome swamp that borders blighted Asarial. These ancient fortifications are built of great blocks of black stone of unknown origin. Walls and towers of of gray limestone from local quarries rise up around the inner defenses. Moss-covered stone stone blocks set in new mortar indicates that these inner defenses were ruined long ago, but have recently been rebuilt using the original stones. The outermost curtain defenses are still in ruins, but the piles of rubble still form an obstacle for attackers and provide cover for the defenders.

## General Features

## Episode 1: The Siege

Once Pentalya acquired a second increment of the Codex of Narastur, she immediate set about to throw off Gothrog's patronage and establish rulership over all of Dhoar. The goblin tribes readily acquiesced, but there was still the matter of the hobgoblin empire in Beranur, whose Emperor, Barazan, considered Dhoar his rightful hegemony. The Troll Queen had planned to brazen things out with the hobgoblins, but in her greed for power, she did not thoroughly research the history of the Codex and so reckoned without the Emperor's counselor Rashazer, the heir of Narastur. Pentalya's use of the artifact to cow the goblins revealed all her intentions to the sorceror, who moved without delay to reclaim his own. Rashazer persuaded Barazan to send a legion of hobgoblin soldiers under Lord Margrond, the famed master of siegecraft, to break Azkruthul and put down its upstart mistress.

Margrond's 12th legion, consisting of 1,000 **hobgoblin soldiers**, 200 **hobgoblin veterans**, 300 **hobgoblin archers**, and 100 **hobgoblin engineers**, made a forced march from Beranur. By secret ways known to Rashazer, the legion arrived in force almost at the very gates of Azkruthul before Pentalya was aware of their approach. The Troll Queen was nonetheless undismayed, for beside the Codex, she has other weapons unknown to Lord Margrond. However, Rashazer does not expect Margrond to take the Codex by military force, nor would he trust the hobgoblins with such a mission even if it were possible. Instead, he has sent three **liches** from his Circle of Seven disguised as advisors to Margrond to see the thing done. Even Lord Margrond is unaware of the existence of the Codex or the true nature of Rashazer's "advisors."

Pentalya has 1,500 **goblin warriors**, 100 **goblin veterans**, 400 **goblin archers**, 100 **trolls**, 100 **ogres**, 100 **half-orcs**, 40 **war trolls**, and 50 **vulture harpies** to defend the fortress. Her personal guard is a cadre of 10 **fell trolls** led by 10 elite **war trolls**. In secret, she has created 20 **troll bladeragers** and 5 **suicide bladeragers** as shock-troops and trained 16 **fell troll catapult** crews. Her ace-in-the-hole is an ancient **black dragon** named Morzog the Vitriolic, who she recruited from the marshes east of the Trollfells by the power of the Codex.

From their previous association as allies in the Seige of Delastarion, Pentalya knows Margrond to be a cautious, patient general. She guesses rightly that he sees Azkruthul Keep as a penultimate challenge and would like to go down in history as the only general to take the place by siege. However, the Troll Queen has no intention of giving the Margrond the time to employ sappers and siege engines. Instead, she has posted a token force of 120 goblin archers and 200 goblin warriors at the outer gate -- just enough to give the illusion of resistance to Margrond's vanguard. She intends to draw the main body of hobgoblins within the outer walls and then have the dragon swoop in from a hiding-place in the marsh to surprise the hobgoblins from the east flank, while her troll bladeragers sally from a secret gate to fall on them from the west flank. Pentalya plans to send her war trolls forth from the inner gate down on the hobgoblin center followed by her most loyal troops -- half-orcs and ogres with close air support from vulture harpies. The Troll Queen is counting on shock and dismay to drive the hobgoblins back against the outer wall, to be bottled up by several columns of goblin warriors, who will come up from hiding in the gullies and rills of the badlands surrounding the fortress. There, she plans to offer the surviving hobgoblins a bargain -- their service for their lives.

Rashazer intended from the outset to use the hobgoblin legion as bait to draw Pentalya into range of the liches. He guesses, rightly, that she will attempt to sway Margrond to her side in person using the power of the Codex.

### Inner Gate Tower

Pentalya had planned use the inner gate tower as her command post, the better to observe the crushing defeat of Margrond's legion. She arranged with Morzog to signal the dragon's attack by sending a signal from the top of the tower. Three **imps** were stationed to tend the fires beneath the cauldrons of pitch on the tower's front battlements.

Alerted by her harpy scouts that the adventurers had occupied the battlements of the inner gate tower, Pentalya was forced to divide her attention between command of her forces and attempts to dislodge the party so that the signal could be given. She has not been wholly successful at either. She was unable to defeat the adventurers or drive them from the tower, but she was able to distract them long enough for a squad of war trolls to signal the dragon to attack. However, the delay this caused was sufficient to allow Margrond's troops to assume formation. As a result, the hobgoblins archers on Margrond's west flank made a stronger resistance than Morzog expected. The dragon was forced to use his acid breath to break the ranks of the hobgoblin mantlet-bearers before he could scatter the archers behind them. In the meantime, he has suffered several volleys from the archers in Margrond's center, who have been so far untroubled by the planned sally of war trolls from the gate tower.

In an attempt to save the day, Pentalya is leading a company of 20 war-trolls down the stairs to the west courtyard. She plans to throw them in behind the bladeragers, who have inflicted grievous casualties on Margrond's west flank. The war trolls are to emerge from the sally-port, followed by 60 trolls and 40 ogres with their half-orc handlers. Pentalya has commanded the remainder of the trolls (10 war trolls and 40 regular trolls) to keep the adventurers bottled up in the inner tower, and has charged the rest of the ogres and half-orcs to defend the keep. She plans to enter the fray herself with her bodyguard to provide the final shock that breaks the hobgoblins' morale.

Like the dragon, Pentalya's harpies have been held at bay by the archers from Margrond's yet-unbroken center. The 40 survivors have regrouped on the western tower and now wait for an opportunity to weigh in once the archie has been neutralized.

Along the outer defenses, the goblin counter-attack was rebuffed by the hobgoblin rearguard, who had entrenched along the ruins of the perimeter wall before the assault began. With the advantage of surprise dissipated, but with little to fear from the legion's archers, the goblins are massing for another attack that they are in no hurry to make.

Margrond has already ordered his troops to fall back on the outer gate, but only his center and guard are likely to be able to do so. In the meantime, Rashazer's liches maintain their disguise and wait for their opportunity.

### Update

Weakened and unsettled by the running battle with the adventurers, Pentalya fell readily into the trap laid for her by the liches. When she arrived to confront Lord Margrond, one of the Circle protected the group with a _Globe of Invulnerability_, one cursed Pentalya with _Evil Eye_, and the third targeted her with _Imprisonment_. Overwhelmed, the hag was minimized and trapped inside a blood-red ruby, which the liches, with droll humor, used a _Wish_ to place inside the most heavily-guarded chamber of her own keep. Done for the day, they took up the Codex of Narastur, which Pentalya had dropped while shrinking, and used Teleportation Circle to return to their fell master with their prize.

Margrond recovered quickly from this sudden betrayal and ordered his bodyguard to form a hollow square bristling with fire-tipped spears. Dismayed by the sudden loss of their leader and faced with a determined, fire-wielding foe, the trolls and ogres of Pentalya's guard fled. Fully aware of the weakness of his tactical position, Margrond kept his troops in formation and did not pursue.

Morzog vented his wrath on the ranks of hobgoblin archers who had stung him so badly only to witness the sudden overthrow of his ally Pentalya. Confronted with a powerful, sorcerous adversary, the dragon decided that discretion was the better part of valor and retired from the field himself, flying north over the outer wall.

The hobgoblins at the gates wisely stayed out of the way of the trolls and ogres, who promptly punched a hole through the goblin line in their unheeding rout. Thinking quickly, the hobgoblins exploited this gap, split the goblin army and turned their center to fall on their flanks. Already unnerved by the passage of the dragon, the goblins soon routed too. The hobgoblins pursued only so far as to ensare that the rout was complete.

A shaken hobgoblin army has won the field. Margrond has looked up from the center of the square to see his own banner waving from the top of the Inner Gate Tower. Now, on to win the keep and Azkruthul is his!

## Episode 2: The Keep

### Keep Level 1

The first level was originally designed at a scale meant to impress. This suits it to the trolls and ogres. 

#### Gatehouse

Iron portcullis and iron-bound wooden doors, massive enough to require two **ogres** (one on either side) to work the winch and bar.

The Seneschal of the Keep is a **nycoloth** named Acabryx. When Pentalya leaves the keep, she charges Acabryx with the defense of the keep. Under such circumstances, he orders the keep on lockdown and sets himself up comfortably in the Great Hall. The ogres have orders to summon him to the gatehouse by means of a bell if anyone seeks admission or attempts to intrude. Acabryx can teleport to the gatehouse or other parts of the keep if an alarm is raised.

#### Atrium

A second portcullis and gate guards the entrance to the Atrium. Acabryx will teleport here and summon aid if a fight in the gatehouse goes against him.

Iron cages hung between the pillars contain the corpses of various creatures that incurred Pentalya's wrath -- including two elves (male and female) and the treasure that the hag mockingly left on them.

**Treasure:** Elven silver fillet headband (130 GP), Elven silver necklace (90 GP) set with a tear-shaped pearl, Elven silver filigree sleeve cuffs (170 GP). 

#### Guard Quarters

Living quarters of 20 half-orc **thugs** and their **veteran** captain.

#### Great Hall

Tawdry splendor in the ill-repaired remains of a once-impressive hall.

#### Kitchen

A nightmare of gross stuff perpetrated by 8 **goblin** scullions and their **goblin boss** chef. Four half-orc **scouts** had arrived with game for the table when the keep went on lock-down.

### Keep Level -1

#### Storerooms

#### Dungeon

### Keep Level -2

#### Cave Complex

#### Experiment Chamber and Cells

### Keep Level -3

#### Gruesome Monster

### Keep Level 2

#### Gatehouse

The second level of the gatehouse is defensive in nature. The floor in the center of the chamber is fitted with a grate through which the defenders can dump **green slime** down on intruders. 

#### Servant Quarters

Living quarters of 20 **goblins** and 15 **half-orcs**, who are domestic slaves. 

#### Presence Chamber

Pentalya holds audience here as suits her regal pretensions. An executioner's block stands at one end, ready to receive fools who provoke the hag's sovereign wrath. When Pentayla holds court, her Executioner, a **hill giant** known as "Splat" attends. His huge maul stands in a corner.

The door to the Conterence Chamber is hidden behind a tapestry on the wall (DC 10).

#### Conference Hall

The door to this room is of thick wood reinforced with black wrought iron. It is fitted with a large lock and handle, also of black wrought iron, fashioned in the shape of a wyvern with tail poised to strike. The door is locked (DC 20) and trapped:

**Poison Dagger Lock**
__Mechanical trap__

Opening the lock without the proper key causes the iron wyvern's tail to lash out with its stinger. A creature in range takes 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A successful DC 15 Intelligence(Investigation) detects the trap. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disarms the trap.

Pentalya intended this fairly obvious trap more to discourage snooping among her servants than to deter intruders.

The hall is finished entirely in polished black marble and has a high vaulted ceiling. Each of the pilasters is set with a sconce, but none of the holds a torch. A dusty and tattered woolen carpet worked with a flame motif in red, yellow, and black runs down the length of the hall. 

At the end of the hall is a large tapestry embroidered with a design of a black unicorn against a background of twisted black trees. In front of this, a table built of massive bones and horns bears a huge skull that has a single eye socket in its forehead. A polished globe of translucent, dark crystal is set into the socket. The globe glimmers faintly with an inner light that resembles sparks swirling over the embers of a dying fire. The sparks seem to form shapes suggestive of creatures, towers, and trees that take shape briefly and fade away.

The crystal globe acts as a permanent sensor for a Crystal Ball of Telepathy in the possession of Gothrog the Tyrant. A creature that gazes into the globe incurs a cumulative 5% chance per round that this will attract Gothrog's attention. While Gothrog is using the crystal as a sensor, the lights coalesce to form an iris of flame within the eye. Gothrog will use the item's _suggestion_ power to compel the creature that activated the globe to tell him what has happened at the fortress.

### Keep Level 3

#### Laboratory

The doors to the laboratory are made of plates of iron riveted together. Each is locked with an internal lock (DC 20) and trapped with a Glyph of Warding (Intelligence(Investigation) DC 17 to detect) that stores Bestow Curse. The glyph will be triggered when the door is unlocked by any creature other than Pentalya. The spell targets a single creature that is touching the door when it is unlocked. The target must make a Wisdom DC 17 saving throw or be cursed for 8 hours. While cursed, the target suffers disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

The laboratory is further guarded by a **spirit naga** named Visserpa. Three **azers** are employed at the forge, which is kept hot by two captive **fire elementals**. Visserpa senses that Pentalya is no longer in control, but he does not know what has happened to her. He and the azers are bound to service as long as Pentalya lives, but the naga would like nothing better than to take his mistress' possessions for himself. The azers and elementals are under Visserpa's command and he will readily spend them in his own defense.

The chamber is a strange mix of operating room and smithy. A forge is set into the north wall and a huge oak table with heavy trestles and a steel-covered top stands in the southwest corner. Oddly-carved tables are littered with gruesome-looking surgical instruments, sturdy smith's tools, and strangely-shaped beakers, flasks, retorts, and alembics, some of which contain powders or liquids in various nauseating hues. Various books and tomes of unwholesome aspect lie scattered about on the tables as well, many of them open. A rack in the southeast corner holds assorted large pieces of plate armor and wicked-looking blades of various lengths, all gleaming and apparently newly-forged.

**Goods:** 2 x Alchemist's supplies, 2 x Smith's tools

**Treasure:** Dust of Dryness, Dust of Sneezing and Choking, Potion of Diminuation, 3 x Potion of Poision, Potion of Vitality, Manual of Monster Command, Manual of Life and Death.  

#### Cage

Thick bars of rusted, but strong steel form the walls and open doors of this chamber. Four steel rings are moored to the floor with long bolts driven deep into the stone. Steel anchor-chains fitted with outsized manacles and waist and neck restraints are reeved through the rings. Large padlocks dangle from the hasps of the doors and restraints.

Dark smears stain the floor, especially around the drain at its center.

Pentalya used this room for various unsavory purposes, usually as a post-op chamber where newly-created bladerager trolls could be restrained to prevent them tearing out their implants while mad with pain.

#### Training Room

Black pillars fashioned in the shape of coiled, many-headed serpents uphold the high ceiling of this once-lavish conference room. Scattered patches and flakes of what were once elaborate frescos in red, ochre, and purple cling to the walls, which like the floors are splotched here and there with sinister stains. Tattered, moldy carpets cover large areas of the flagstone floor.

At the center of the room stands a **wood golem**, an enormous construct of thick logs rudely fashioned into humanoid shape and crudely carved with a leering face. The construct's massive limbs and torso are wrapped in tightly-twisted hemp ropes as thick as ship's cables. The wrappings are scarred and frayed with many deep cuts, but any severely damaged sections have been replaced with newer rope.

**Compelled Duel Trap**

_Magical Trap_

As soon as a creature steps in to the area within the pillars, a _wall of force_ will spring up, enclosing the area and extending all the way to the ceiling. Only one creature will be pushed inside the area -- others will be pushed out. The creature inside the area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target will be compelled by a _geas_ to duel the golem alone and unaided using only the melee weapon(s) it bears in its hands -- unarmed if it bears no weapon. A charmed target takes the typical 5d10 psychic damage if it violates these conditions, even if it only permits others to assist. The _wall of force_ will last for 1 minute.

If a creature is trapped inside the wall, the golem will animate and attack. The golem will continue to attack its target until the target is reduced to 0 hit points, is no longer visible, or leaves the room -- at which point the golem will return to the center of the room and de-animate.

#### Tower Entrance

## Episode 3: The Tower

Pentalya has her quarters in the Tower. The rooms here reflect her macabre interests and the results of the various defensive enchantents she has placed on them.

### Tower Level 1

The stone archway to the Guard Chamber is warded by a massive double-door of sturdy oak bound in iron protected by an iron portcullis. Enormous knockers wrought of iron are mounted on the valves of the door. Both the door and the portcullis are closed and locked. The guards will open them on hearing a special code rapped out on the knockers ("38DD" in Morse Code: ...-- ---.. -.. -..) 

Like the first level of the Keep, the scale of the first level of the Tower is suitable for Large-sized occupants. 

#### Guard Chamber

The whole first level of the tower is a single chamber with a ceiling 25 feet high. A stone stairway climbs one wall to the next level.

**Lightning Trap**

_Mechanically Triggered Electrical Trap_

In the center of the ceiling is an ornate copper rod that extends down 5 feet to terminate in a ball. An identical construction stands in the middle of the floor. In a storm, lightning continually arcs between these poles. All along the west wall are a set of metal cabinets filled with strange coils of wire, tubes of bubbling fluid, and odd ceramic cones. A large switch is mounted conspicuously on the wall in the center of the cluster of cabinets. When the switch is open, the path to ground is cut off, which causes a bolt of lightning to strike a random creature in the room each round. The creature struck must make a DC 17 Dexterity save. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The chamber is guarded by two **ogre golems**. Their orders are to open the portcullis and door upon hearing a special coded knock. They are also under orders to attack any creature except Pentalya that enters the room. With them is a crazed, hunchbacked **dwarf** named Eigor, whose only job it is to throw the switch if intruders enter. The golems don't mind at all being struck by lightning, but Eigor does, so as soon as his duty is done, he will run up the stairs and bar the door behind him.

Four large double-doors of orichalcum-sheathed wood open into this chamber. The doors have cast-orichalcum pull-handles in the shape of wyverns. The chamber is one large room (the staircase does not exist in this plane).

In the center of the chamber, an open-work cylinder of wrought orichalcum ten feet wide extends from the floor to the apex of the ceiling high above. A tightly-stretched copper cable runs down the center of the cylinder, but the spaces in the openwork of the cylinder are too small to admit even an arrow.

**Guards:**

20 **vulture harpies**

#### Staircase

The staircase on this level is actually an extra-dimensional space created with Mordenkainen's Baffling Passage. It can be entered only by entering the door from the outside. However, a creature that descends the staircase without reciting a special incantation known only to Pentayla will, after descending 10 feet, suddenly be expelled from the extra-dimensional space into thin air 200 feet above the courtyard in front of the Gatetower.
