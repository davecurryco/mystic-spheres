**Multiattack.** The chest makes two attacks.

**Pincer.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.

**Petrifying Gas (Recharge 5-6).** The chest spews poisonous gas in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (2d6 + 3) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

An **Animated Strongbox** is similar to other animated objects. It appears to be a normal metal strongbox, but when it awakens, a pair of crab-like claws and six many-jointed legs unfold from its body and it scuttles to the attack. Artificers and wizards often create these constructs to guard and transport their treasure at the same time. Particularly vindictive creators will instruct an animated strongbox to use its powerful pincers to immediately break up creatures petrified by its gas attack.
