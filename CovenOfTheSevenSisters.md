# Coven of the Seven Sisters

The _Coven of the Seven Sisters_ is an unusually powerful and well-connected coven of seven hags of various types. These hags are not actually related to each other, but were brought together by a bond of fate related to their pacts. Their bond may be related to some dark conspiracy among their pact sponsors.

Despite their geographical separation, the Sisters collaborate and cooperate to an unusual degree. Somehow, they have avoided the internal rivalries that split most hag covens larger than three members.

In addition to their pact with the dark fey powers, the Sisters also have dealings with infernal principalities, through which they have gained contacts, allies and abilities not normally associated with hags. They have developed a protocol by which they communicate with one another magically each night at the rising of the moon. The Sisters have also worked out a cypher with which they encrypt their ritual-books to keep them secret (mainly from other hags). This is not a language, so it is not readable with a _Comprehend Languages_ spell.
