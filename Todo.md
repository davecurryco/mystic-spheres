WikiPack lets you make ad-hoc todo lists _(with paid plans)_ anywhere in any of your pages. Simply add a hyphenated list, and it will become a todo list:

- Mark an item as done by clicking on its checkbox, or the item itself
- Add you own todo list by editing the page
    - Todo list items can be indented
        - Several levels deep!
- You can use Markdown formatting like **bold** and _italic_ within todo items!
- Done items have a tag like this: @done

When you mark an item as done, WikiPack will add a @done tag and automatically insert a timestamp.

You can mix todo lists with regular bulleted lists and numbered lists on the same page:

Bulleted list:

* list one
* list two
    * indented

Numbered lists:

1. one
2. two
3. etc
