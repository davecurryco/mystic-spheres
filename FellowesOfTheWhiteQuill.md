# Fellowes of the White Quill

The _Fellowes of the White Quill_ is a society of wizards comprised mainly of academics of Caldorin University in Taur-Essealon and Eleannon College in Telenarion. Its members are openly dedicated to the pursuit and preservation of arcane knowledge and privately sworn to the guardianship of its more dangerous secrets. The Fellowes also act to ensure the continued political independence and academic freedoms of the two great institutions of arcane learning. The Fellowes are secretly in possession of several manuscript pages of the Codex of Narastur. They seek to gather the rest so that the evil tome may be destroyed.
