# The Trollfell Barrows

## Introduction

The Azruun embalmed their dead lords and buried them in barrow chambers surrounded by treasure and the bodies of their concubines and servitors. To forstall grave-robbers, these tombs were built in secret sites in forbidding places and guarded with spells of hiding and warding.

The Trollfells were a natural location to entomb the Azruun wizard-commanders who fell in battle with the elves during the Siege of Asarial. It was these barrows and the secrets that lay within that first drew the hag Pentalya to the area. Through her arcane arts, she succeeded in locating many tombs that had lain hidden under enchantments for many centuries. In some, she found riches and lore which she took for her own. Others she found intact but strangely vacant of the personages who, according to the inscriptions on the doorposts and lintels, should by rights have lain within. A few she found occupied by the wraiths of Azruun sorcerers too powerful or wicked to go quietly into the shadow lands beyond the mortal world. These she wisely left alone.

There are seven barrows in all. They are similar in construction, but each has a unique character depending on the personage it was built to inter and the extent to which that personage lingers on the site.

## 1: Barrow of Gereshara-kal (Azruun Battlelord)

_Occupied and plundered_

A mighty war leader of the Azruun, Gereshara-kal was assassinated by a rival (Ranzer). His embalmed body was entombed in this dolmen, but his soul had been pledged to infernal powers. Raised as a wight battle commander, Gereshara-kal served his diabolical masters as a centurion of undead legions for centuries until Pentalya co-opted him to lead her own security forces in the area. He does this at the head of his own life-guard, who were interred with him at his death and subsequently raised as wights themselves.

As Gereshara-kal had no use for treasure, Pentalya took every last copper piece from this tomb to finance her early career.

### Appearance

The dolmen is an oval mound about 60 feet wide and 75 feet long. It is covered with grass and is about 15 feet high at the crown. The north-facing entrance is fronted by a dry-stone wall on either side of the doorway. It is marked by a wooden pole about 15 feet high that bears a crossbar to which a standard made of hide is attached. The standard is vaguely greenish and is blazoned with a long-fingered, taloned hand drawn in yellow.

### Entrance

The doorway is framed by stone posts with a large lintel above. The door itself is of stone a little over a foot thick. It is counterweighted and can be opened (Strength DC 17), but it currently stands ajar. The door is incised with Azruun runes framing a device depicting a double-headed axe. Inside, an unlit passageway opens on the Antechamber

### Antechamber

This unlit small room is lined and flagged in gray stone, as are all the halls and chamber of this barrow unless otherwise noted. Its ceiling is only 7 feet high.

On either side of the chamber are ossuaries used to inter the bones of Gereshara-kal's enemies (on the left) and servants (on the right). Their doors are made of bars of rusted wrought-iron worked in the shapes of swords and spears. The doors are rusted shut (Thievery DC 30 to open). The bones are arranged in racks of the same design and materials. There are thirty-three skeletons in each ossuary, for a total of 66. An infernal curse spelled out in Azruun runes on the lintels the doors of the cells will generate a random skeleton from each ossuary each turn to wreak revenge on anyone who damages or destroys anything within the tomb. This applies to attacks against Gereshara-kal or his servants.


If the curse is activated, one skeletons will appear in each of the two squares outside the ossuary doors each turn. The skeletons will immediately move to attack any intruders in the tomb.

The passage to the Treasure Chamber and stairway is blocked by an iron door of the same type as the ossuary doors. It is closed and the hinges are rusty, but it can be opened readily (Stength DC 7).

### Treasure Chamber

This room once contained a fortune in grave-goods, but Pentalya took them. Mindful of the curse, she used magical aid to do so without damaging anything. For this reason, the chests, urns and amphorae in this chamber are intact (as are the traps that protect several of them), but there is not so much as a copper piece worth of treasure in any of them.

The door is of rusted iron and its lock is frozen (Strength/Thievery DC 32 to open).

### Guards' Burial Chamber

Four members of Gereshara-kal's elite bodyguard were buried along with him. Their gray stone sarcophagi pack this otherwise unadorned chamber. The Azruun consider this an honor, so these were not the guards who failed to prevent the battlelord's assassination. The bond of honor was such that the bodyguard were raised as wights along with their master.

The door to this chamber is of rusty iron in the same design as the ones to the ossuaries. It is not locked and although the hinges are rusted, they are not frozen (Strength DC 11 to open). Inside, the stone lids of the sarcophagi lie cracked and broken on the floor or leaning against the sarcophagi. The mummified corpes of the bodyguard lie inside the sarcophagi with their hands folded over their chests on the hilts of their longswords.

An iron weapons rack lines one wall. It once contained a variety of valuable and even magical weapons, but these have all been taken.

4 Battle Wights (Level 9 Soldier)

Although the battle wights spend most of their time in their sarcophagi, they are on duty at all times (make passive perception checks for the wights to notice intruders at the entrance or in the antechamber). They will certainly come to Gereshara-kal's aid if he is attacked. A wight can rise from its sarcophagi as a minor action by what amounts to a teleport. The wraith dissolves to shadows and immediately re-forms in an adjacent square. The wraiths also ignore the difficult terrain caused by the rubble of the sarcophagi lids.

### Master Burial Chamber

Gereshara-kal was buried with two of his wives in this chamber. The door is made of gray stone and is carved with a border of Azruun runes surrounding a central design featuring the same double-headed axe. It is unlocked, but it is closed and is massive (Strength DC 23 to open). The chamber itself is lined with well-fitted granite blocks and flagged with dark-gray shale. A square central pillar supports the ceiling.

The sarcophagi are made of black marble on which are incised bands of Azruun runes. The lids of these are shattered and their pieces are scattered around the floor. Gereshara-kal's sarcophagus is larger and rests on a raised dais of black marble. At its head, a black marble statue of a bat-winged serpent stands in a large niche in the wall.

2 Deathlock Wights (Level 4 Controller)

Battle Wight Commander (Level 12 Soldier - Leader) - Gerenshara-kal

Like the bodyguard, the wights in this room are aware and can rise to face attackers with a minor action. They too ignore the difficult terrain from the rubble of the sarcophagi lids and grave goods. If Gereshara-kal is threatened, he can cause the door to swing shut immediately (Strength DC 30 to resist). He can also trigger a magical trap built into the statue.

Shadow Blast (Level 8 Elite Blaster) XP 700

The barrow-wight speaks a word of command and the statue breathes a blast of shadow that fills every corner of the room -- dampening even the strongest light and gripping all within with the chill of the grave.

Trap: The statue breathes a blast of negative energy that fills the room for 10 turns.

Perception  
DC 14 - The mouth of the statue gapes in a manner suggestive of forcible exhalation.  
DC 17 - The base of the statue is carved with Azruun runes of a decidedly arcane character.  

Trigger
The trap can be triggered as a minor action by the chief occupant of the tomb in which it is set.

Standard Action - Area: The entire room

Attack: +14 vs. Reflex; 3d8 + 8 necrotic and cold damage; Miss: Half-damage

Effect: Living creatures that enter or begin their turns in the area of effect take 5 points of necrotic and cold damage and must save or be weakened for that turn. All light sources, normal and magical, in the area of effect at the time of the attack are immediately extinguished, although they can be relit. In subsequent turns, dim light sources cannot penetrate the darkness at all. Bright light sources are treated as dim and can only illuminate a single square radius. These effects last for 10 turns or until the statue is destroyed.

Countermeasures  
The statue can be destroyed (AC/Reflex 5, Fortitude 10, HP 80, Immune cold)

The chests and urns in this room are closed and locked (Thievery DC 23), but are empty.

## 2: Barrow of Marakanar (Azruun Diabolist Master)

_Unoccupied and intact_

One of Narastur's original Circle of Seven, Marakanar was killed in the Siege of Asarial and was replaced by his apprentice. His body was entombed here with treasure and sacrifices appropriate to his position, but in some haste on account of the state of the war at that time. For this reason, Marankanar's tomb is one of the least elaborate of the barrows, despite his high status.

Marakanar was one of the first Azruun reincarnated by Narastur upon the latter's return to power. This act de-animated his corpse, which lies mummified within in the burial chamber. In consideration of Marakanar's continued service, Narastur awarded him this tomb with all its treasures. These are guarded not only by the reanimated corpses of Marakanar's servitors, but also by traps and wards placed by Narastur himself. Pentalya located this dolmen, but found that the entrance was protected with a powerful ward. Knowing that there have been but a few wizards in all of history who could have placed such an enchantment, Pentalya guessed it's likely caster and left the place well alone.

### Appearance

The barrow is covered by a low mound set into the side of a hill among boulders, shrubs and heather. The entrance is unmarked and the doorposts and lintel are roughly-hewn local stone barely distinguishable from the surrounding rocks. For these reasons, the dolmen is difficult to find (Nature DC 23).

### Entrance

The lintel of the entryway is incised with runes carved in a thin, spidery fashion. They comprise a powerful spell of warding:

Curse of the Seventh Seal Level 24 Warder

Trap XP 6,000

Runes written around the door suddenly glow and explode as you try to open it.

Trap: A powerful curse wards a portal, ready to lash out in arcane fury when the trap is triggered.

Perception  
DC 17: The character notices the runes, but does not necessarily recognize that they are magic.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 36: The character understands the character of the curse and provides a +2 bonus to Thievery checks made to disable it.

Trigger  
When a creature tries to open the guarded portal or pass through it, the runes explode.

Attack  
Immediate Reaction Close burst 3  
Targets: All creatures in burst  
Attack: +29 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 5d10+5 cold damage and immobilized (save ends)  
Miss: Half damage, no immobilization

Aftereffect: Creatures hit in the first attack take 5d10+5 necrotic damage and are weakened (save ends); A zone of darkness persists in the area of effect for 3 turns. Living creatures that enter or begin their turns in the area of effect take 5 points of necrotic and cold damage and must save or be weakened for that turn. All light sources, normal and magical, in the area of effect at the time of the attack are immediately extinguished, although they can be relit. In subsequent turns, dim light sources cannot penetrate the darkness at all. Bright light sources are treated as dim and can only illuminate a single square radius.
Countermeasures

An adjacent character can disable the runes with a DC 36 Thievery check. Failure triggers the curse.

Special  
As long as the seal is in place, the portal it guards gains resist 20 to all damage.

The door protected by this ward is of stone 6 inches thick. It cannot be opened as long as the arcane seal is in place. Once the seal is removed, the door can be opened with a Strength DC 35 check. If the seal is triggered, the lintel will crack and although the door may be opened, it cannot be closed completely.

### Antechamber

This unlit chamber is lined in gray stone. The barrel-vaulted ceiling is 10 feet high. Two passageways open to the right and left, but these are sealed off with portcullises of black wrought iron, both seemingly fresh-forged. The portcullises have no winch or counterweights and can only be raised by brute force. Each of the portcullises is held shut with an Arcane Lock ritual (Strength/Thievery DC 41 to open).

At the opposite end of the chamber is a larger-than-life statue in black marble. It is in the form of a cloaked and hooded humanoid figure with head bowed and hands folded inside its sleeves. The face cannot be seen within the hood, nor can the feet be seen beneath the robe. It emits a palpable aura of evil.

The statue was intended as a tribute to Marakanar and its economy of form is a result of the haste in which it had to be carved. The sense of evil it emits can be explained in part by the oubliette hidden beneath its base, which contains the skeletons of three elven female buried alive, also in tribute to the departed sorcerer. Narastur cursed these victims to rise as banshees compelled to keen for Marakanar and guard his tomb.

3 Wailing Ghosts - Banshees (Level 12 Controller)

The statue emits a zone of darkness that fills all of the chamber. This is akin to the effect of the Ward of the Seventh Seal. Dim light sources cannot penetrate the darkness at all. Bright light sources are treated as dim and can only illuminate a single square radius. The banshees will collect in this zone of darkness, wait until the intruders are off-guard, and emerge from the statue to attack. The spirits will focus their attacks on whichever of the intruders seems most vulnerable. Their goal is to take down an enemy as quickly as possible to join their dead master and they will cooperate to do so.

### Offering Chamber

This room contains a variety of wooden chests, ceramic urns and bronze bowls. These once contained all matter of precious goods, but their contents are all decayed to dust and rust.

### Portal Chamber

A magic circle engraved in silver in the floor of this chamber is a teleportation portal linked to a permanent portal in Beranur. It is intended for transportation, but its situation makes it an effective trap as well.

Shadow Portal Level 7 Minion Obstacle

Hazard XP 75

When a creature attempts to cross a 10-foot diameter circle inscribed on the floor it is teleported through the sphere of shadow to a dangerous destination.

Trap: Once a day, a permanent linked portal activates when a creature enters one of the squares it occupies (a 2x2 area). The portal stays open for three rounds after activation, during which time any number of creatures can cross in either direction subject to normal rules of movement. Once closed, the portal cannot be used again until moonrise. The negative energy unleashed when the portal activates harms the creature that is transported and also creatures nearby on either side of the portal.

Perception  
DC 11: A circle of arcane writings is inscribed on the floor.  
DC 19: The circle seems to glow with a pale light and emit cold.  
DC 24: The floor within the circle seems to fade in and out with a floor of a different pattern and materials.  

Trigger  
The portal activates when a creature attempts to enter one of the squares it occupies. The triggering creature and any creature that enters one of the portal's squares is immediately teleported to the linked destination portal.

Effect  
Creatures who are teleported by the circle take 3d8 + 5 cold and necrotic damage and lose a healing surge unless resistant to both cold and necrotic damage.

Attack  
Immediate Reaction Area 2 adjacent squares  
Target: Each creature in the area  
Attack: +10 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 3d8 + 5 cold and necrotic damage, and the target is weakened.  
Miss: Half damage, and the target is pushed 1 square. 

Countermeasures  
An adjacent character can efface the magic circle without triggering it (Thievery DC 37).

The other side of the portal is located on the domed, stone roof of the ruins of a sorcerer's tower atop a snow-covered mountain in northern Beranur. It is guarded by six gargoyles, who sit in stone form atop high, claw-shaped merlons spaced evenly around the top of the tower. The gargoyles will immediately attack intruders, shrieking loudly all the while, but will retreat to their perches and revert to stone form when bloodied. The roof is covered in ice and snow and there is no wall or railing around the roof:

5 Gargoyles (Level 9 Lurker)

2 Nabassu Gargoyles (Level 18 Lurker)

Treacherous Ice Sheet Level 5 Elite Obstacle

Hazard XP 400

A slick sheet of ice creates a hazardous obstacle.

Hazard: This sheet of ice fills all squares of the roof, turning them into difficult terrain.

Perception  
No check is necessary to notice the ice.

Additional Skill: Nature  
DC 22: The character identifies the squares of treacherous ice.

Trigger  
The ice attacks when a creature enters or begins its turn in a square of treacherous ice. It also attacks when a creature stands up from prone in a square of treacherous ice.

Attack  
Opportunity Action Melee  
Target: Creature on the ice  
Attack: +10 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 1d6+2 damage, fall prone and slide 1 square toward the edge of the roof. If the creature is already prone, no damage but it slides 1 square toward the edge of the roof and its turn ends immediately. Creatures who are already on a square at the edge of the roof must save or fall off.  

Countermeasures  
With a DC 27 Acrobatic check and a move action, a character can move into a square of treacherous ice without risk of falling. If the check fails or the character moves more than 1 square, the ice attacks.

The tower is 150 feet high and overlooks a 600 foot cliff on the west side. Creatures who fall off the tower on that side will take the usual 15d10 of damage and will land on a snow-covered ledge, from which creature must save or fall off the cliff.

Stone steps wind steeply down the inside of the tower from their head on the west side (naturally) of the tower roof. Their wooden railings have long since rotted away. The wooden floors are gone as well, although seven rings of holes and supports show where their supporting timbers once were. Deep window slots also mark where the levels of the tower once were. There are 5 squares of stairs for each of the seven levels. The first 5 squares of the stairs are subject to the same icy conditions as the roof. The rest count as difficult terrain as follows:

Not Up to Code Stairs Level 3 Obstacle

Hazard XP 150

The stone stairs are steep and dangerous, with many crumbling edges and gaps. Some particularly treacherous sections are likely to give way completely.

Hazard: Time and the elements have deteriorated the condition of these stairs, turning them into difficult terrain.

Perception  
DC 13: The character notices that the stairs are untrustworthy.  

Additional Skill: Dungeoneering  
DC 22: The character identifies the visible squares that are likely to give way.  

Trigger  
The stairs attack when a creature enters or begins its turn in a treacherous square (d20 per square of movement; 1-2 indicates a treacherous square).

Attack  
Opportunity Action Melee  
Target: Creature on the treacherous square  
Attack: +10 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 1d6+2 damage, fall prone and slide 1 square in a random direction. If the creature is already prone, no damage but its turn ends immediately. Creatures who slide over the edge of the stairs must save or fall off.  

Countermeasures  
With a DC 27 Acrobatic check and a move action, a character can move into a square of treacherous ice without risk of falling. If the check fails or the character moves more than 1 square, the ice attacks.

The gargoyles won't mind at all pursuing the party down the stairs since the interior of the tower is essentially open.

On the second floor, the staircase comes to a landing which continues on the other side of an empty doorway. The stairs then continue on the outside of the tower down to a narrow ledge on the west side of the tower overlooking the cliff. Characters will find that the ledge ends in a cliff wall on the north side of the tower, but continues around the south side to a slope on a peak of one mountain in a range that extends as far as can be seen in all directions. The air is thin and the weather conditions look ominous.

The point of all this is to convince any characters who come through the portal that their best bet is to go back the way they came. If they don't take the hint, some extreme weather might get the point across.

### Vault Chamber

The doors to this unlit chamber are made of thick, black iron, but they are not at all rusted. They are locked with an integrated lock (Thievery DC 30 to open) which is sealed with a large silver seal stamped with an arcane sigil:

Sigil of Sealing Level 15 Warder

Trap XP 1,200

A glowing, red arcane sigil seals the door. When the seal is broken, the sigil erupts into a swarm of tiny, fiery demons that sting and burn all exposed flesh.

Trap: A magical sigil silently wards a portal, threatening dire consequences if it is unsealed.

Perception  
DC 7: The character notices the sigil.  

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 23: The character understands that the sigil can only be disabled by successive application of Arcana and Thievery skills.  
DC 30: The character understands the character of the sigil and provides a +2 bonus to Arcana and Thievery checks made to disable it.  

Trigger  
When a creature tries to open the seal or destroy the guarded portal, the sigil attacks.

Attack  
Immediate Reaction Wall 8 within 1 square  
Targets: All creatures in blast  
Attack: +19 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 4d10 + 4 fire and poison damage and the target slides 1 square in a random direction.  
Miss: Half damage and the target does not slide.  

Countermeasures
An adjacent character can disable the sigil with a DC 30 Arcana check followed immediately by a DC 35 Thievery check.

The ceiling of this gray slate lined chamber is 12 feet high. At the far end stands a vault of black granite that is partly built into a niche in the wall. It is shaped somewhat like a classical Greek temple, with a simple carved base, corner-posts and eaves. The side nearest the door features two rectangular spaces that look like doors, but are actually stone slabs mortared into place. These are carved with arcane Azruun runes of a decidedly evil character among which appear the names Suguro, Chengra and Arakran.

This is the tomb of Marakanar's personal bodyguard, who were voluntarily interred here with him. Their mummified bodies lie on rune-carved stone slabs inside the vault. The runes on the slabs are a curse that will raise the spirits of these warriors as wraiths to stalk and destroy intruders who breach the door to the burial chamber.

3 Sword Wraiths (Level 17 Lurker)

If the secret door is opened or their tomb is damaged, the wraiths will phase through the walls of their vault to attack. If the situation permits, they will wait for a good opportunity to make the most of the element of surprise to gain combat advantage. If bloodied in combat, a wraith will return to its slab inside the vault to regenerate.

On either side of the vault is a man-size funerary urn of black cast-iron decorated in the spiked motifs favored by the Azruun. Inside each is the dessicated corpse of a human serving-girl who was sealed alive in the urn with compounds that would preserve her body after death. Each corpse wears a collar-necklace of enameled gold and jade (250 GP) with matching earrings (100 GP) and wrist-bracelets (150 GP). One of the necklaces lies in pieces around the feet of the serving-girl who wore it -- torn off in her struggles as she suffocated. The spirits of these unfortunate wenches were bound to serve their master in the shadow-world.

2 Wailing Ghosts - Banshees (Level 12 Controller)

These use the Trap Haunt's Ghostly Possession in place of Terrifying Shriek.

In the right wall is a secret door (Thievery DC 27 to find) that leads to a passage to the tombs. It is made of the same gray slate as the lining of the wall and is locked with a one-way catch (Thievery DC 27 to open).

### Guardian Chamber

This unlit chamber is of much the same construction as the Vault Chamber. At one end stands a larger-than-life-size, limestone statue of a stylized warrior in lamellar armor. The figure is unarmed except for a cruelly-spiked cestus on each hand. The room is otherwise unadorned.

The statue is actually a stone golem whose orders, given by Narastur, were "Kill any living creature in this room. Stand here unless you must move to attack. Return here when there are no living creatures in this room."

Stone Golem (Level 17 Elite Soldier)

On the left side of the room, a stairway leads down to the Burial Chamber.

### Burial Chamber

This chamber is clad in gray stone like the others and is similarly unadorned. However, near one end is a large vault of black granite of similar design as the one in the Vault Chamber, except that it is made of better stone and its finish and carvings are finer. There are Azruun runes carved in a continuous border around the base of the vault that glow faintly with a bluish-purple flame, but otherwise the room is entirely dark.

At each corner of the base of the vault, the skeleton of a woman is chained by the ankles to a ring set in the floor. These were Marakanar's wives and concubines. The were sealed alive in the burial chamber with their dead lord and left to suffocate. They died huddled together in pairs. Their jewelry lies scattered among the dust and faint scraps of clothing amid their bones (2 necklaces worth 500 GP, 1 necklace worth 350 GP, 1 necklace worth 220 GP, 2 gold waist-chains worth 170 GP, 3 ankle-bracelets worth 130 GP, 6 earrings worth 75 GP, 8 earrings worth 50 GP, 2 nose-rings worth 20 GP, 23 body-piercing studs worth 5 GP).

The runes at the base of the vault are a magical trap that protects the vault and its surroundings. There is a border of similar runes at the top. These once bound Marakanar's spirit to his mummy and provided it with access to the mortal world, but they were deactivated upon his reincarnation.

Shadow Tendrils Level 13 Elite Obstacle

Trap XP 800

Shadowy tendrils whip from the ground to lash at you.

Trap: This trap extends to an area of 2 squares from a band of runes that is its focus. When a living creature steps into the area of this attack, shadowy tendrils lash out and attack, pinning the creature's limbs to the floor.  Creatures who succumb are drawn down into the shadow-realm from which the tendrils originate.

Perception  
DC 27: The character notices something strange about the area ahead, as though a shadowy mist hangs just above the ground.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 23: The character recognizes that the runes around the base of the vault are the focus of an enchantment.  
DC 31: The character’s knowledge provides a +2 bonus to Thievery checks to disable the trap.  

Trigger  
When a creature enters or begins its turn in a trapped square, the trap attacks.

Attack  
Opportunity Action Melee  
Target: Creature in trapped square  
Attack: +18 vs. AC  
Hit: 2d10 + 6 necrotic damage and the tendrils make a secondary attack.  
Secondary Attack: +18 vs. Will. Hit: Target is stunned until the end of the target’s next turn. Miss: Target is immobilized until the end of the target's next turn.  
Special: Targets reduced to 0 hit points or below must save each turn or be drawn down through the floor into the realm of shadows.
Countermeasures  
A character who makes a DC 27 Acrobatics check can move through a trigger square without provoking the attack. The squares count as difficult terrain.  
A character adjacent to the runes can disable the trap with a DC 31 Thievery check.  

The vault is surrounded with gilded wooden chests and enameled bronze urns containing treasure:

* Urn: 7,000 GP
* Urn: 40 PP
* Urn: 9,000 SP
* Chest: Emerald set in a gold cloak brooch (1,000 GP)
* Chest: Ceremonial lamellar breastplate of enameled gold (5,000 GP); Enameled gold headdress (2,500 GP)
* Chest: Ceremonial scepter of enameled gold topped with a clear crystal skull (7,500 GP)
* Chest: Large, deep purple jacinth set in a platinum base (5,000 GP)
* Chest: Sapphire set in a silver fillet (1,000 GP); Shadowfell Gloves (Lvl 16)
* Chest: Ring of Invisibility (Lvl 18)

Inside the vault (Strength/Thievery DC 23 to open), there is an inner sarcophagus of black-stained wood. This is decorated with runes and carvings that pronounce a curse on any creature that opens the sarcophagus or causes it to be opened (for example, by a Knock ritual or by a summoned or dominated creature):

Curse of the Shadow Nemesis Level 18 Curse

Curse XP 1,200

Your own shadow turns against you each time you battle a foe

Curse: The curse affects a single creature who violates a set prohibition. The curse causes the creature's own shadow to become an enemy whenever the creature is in combat.

Perception  
DC 17: The character notices that the runes glow faintly with a unearthly blue-black light.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 23: The character recognizes that the runes are the focus of a curse, not a trap. There is no physical means to counter it.  
DC 32: The character discovers the conditions that will trigger the curse.  

Trigger  
When a creature violates the prohibition of the curse, the curse immediately attacks that creature.

Attack  
Opportunity Action  
Target: Creature violating the prohibition  
Attack: +22 vs. Will  
Hit: The creature is cursed  
Effect: In each combat that takes place in dim or brighter light, the affected creature's shadow is treated as an ally of the creature's enemies for the purposes of flanking. The creature also takes 5 points of necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns while in combat.  
Cure: The curse is permanent. It can be removed from an affected creature by a Remove Affliction ritual with a Heal result check of 20 or higher.  

Countermeasures  
A creature can be defended against the curse's attack by any power that boosts the Will defense, such as Cloak of Peace.

Inside the sarcophagus is the mummified body of the sorcerer Marakanar. He wears a tunic of gold plates laced together with fine gold wire (500 GP) and wears a headdress of beaten gold plates (750 GP). His withered hands clutch a Staff of Shadowy Might +4 (Lvl 16). This is essentially the same as a Staff of Fiery Might, but substitutes necrotic for the fire keyword.
