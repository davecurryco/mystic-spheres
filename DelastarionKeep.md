# Delastarion Keep

_Map:_ DDH 2015 pg 17 Chainspire Fortress

_Map:_ DDH 2015 pg 18 Chainspire Dungeon

Delastarion Castle stands on the site of an ancient tower built of massive blocks of a strange green stone. The Telenar raised the keep on the toppled tower's foundation and reused the blocks that were scattered about the site as the foundations of the castle's outer walls and towers. Thus, the architecture superimposes typical Telenar design in the upper stories on a more monumental substructure.

The castle was the last resort of Delastarion's defenders when the goblins overran the town. The Telenar settlers drove off several attempts to storm the gates and walls. The barbican gate fell in these assaults, but the outer wall, which was defended on the east side by the moat, held. At last, seven red-robed mages protected by war-trolls holding huge shields blasted a gap in the north wall between the outboard gate tower and the wall defense tower.

Gorbast has been the target of several assassination attempts, so the castle stays at a heightened level of security at all times.

## Outer Wall

The outer wall is 40 feet high and 15 feet thick at its base, tapering to 10 feet at the top. It is embattled and a new hoarding of timber has been built along the top, adding an additional 10 feet to the effective height of the walls.

The granite stonework was damaged in many places during the assault and the goblins repaired the walls in those places with cruder techniques and materials. The large gap in the north wall has been patched with rough stone blocks and filled with rubble.

Each segment of the outer wall is patrolled by two hobgoblin archers of Gorbast's guard. Each bears a horn and it is their first duty to raise an alarm at any indication of an attack.

16 Hobgoblin Archers (Level 3 Artillery)

## Barbican Gate

The barbican gate has walls 30 feet high and 10 feet thick at the base, tapering to 5 feet at top. The gatehouse walls stand 30 feet high as well. The walls are crenelated and an iron fence with sharp, outward-pointing stakes is fixed in the top. The gate towers took heavy damage but have since been repaired. The gate has been rebuilt on the great iron hinge pinions that hung empty for many years. A new portcullis has replaced the old, which had been roughly repaired and pressed back into service after the seige.

The portcullis is usually let down. An ogre enforcer and his half-orc handler stand watch outside. The half-orc will admit no one except on business with Gorbast.

Ogre Enforcer (Level 10 Brute)

Half-Orc Thug (Level 7 Brute)

### Barbican Gate Tower Ground Floor (Level 1)

This windowless chamber is used by the half-orc gatekeepers when they are not on duty. Stairs lead to the first floor and this is the only access.

The half-orcs are a rough lot and the room is a jumble of bedding, equipment, weapons, food, and detritus. The southeast corner is kept clear for games of lagrak, a game of chance played with bones. Unless an alarm has been sounded, the off-duty guards will be so deeply engaged in this pastime they can be easily surprised (DC 11 Stealth check). 

2 Half-Orc Thugs (Level 7 Brute)

### Barbican Gate Tower First Floor (Level 2)

The stairs that lead to this chamber provide the only access to the tower. Arrow-slits face outward and an archway in the south wall leads to a walkway over the gate 15 feet above ground level. The walkway is crenelated and fitted with wooden hoardings front and back to provide cover for defenders to drop unpleasant objects down on anyone attempting to force the gate. A rack on the west wall holds polearms and sheafs of arrows.

During the hours when the castle is open for business, the gatekeeper, a half-orc thug-master named Ufthuk, usually sits at a table in the northwest corner of this room, playing endless games of "grokkrad-thak", a kind of solitaire that uses bone tiles. Whenever strangers present themselves to the half-orc on gate duty, he will pull a rope which rings a bell in this room to summon Ufthuk. The thug-master will then come out onto the walkway and rule from above on whether the strangers should be admitted. His manner in this is usually curt and his speech is laced with curses and abuse directed toward his underlings. He is contemptuous of goblins and never fails to belittle any of that race he deals with. However, Ufthuk is very perceptive, insightful and streetwise - extraordinarily so for a half-orc. Little escapes his scrutiny, which is why he is valuable to Gorbast.

Half-Orc Thug-Master (Level 7 Elite Brute) - Ufthuk

## Main Gate

### Main Gate Tower Ground Floor (Level 1)

The main gate is protected by a drawbridge and porticullis. The gate and drawbridge are newly constructed of rough-hewn timber with repaired iron fittings. The portcullis is new and is a sturdy mesh of iron bars wrought in the distinctive, spiked style of the dark dwarves and painted black to preserve it from rust.

Both towers have doors inside the walls that give access to a ground floor chamber. The drawbars for the gates are drawn into these chambers. 

### Main Gate Tower First Floor (Level 2)

The chambers to the north and south of the main gate tunnel on this level house the windlasses by which the drawbridge and porticullis are raised and lowered. A wide archway in each chamber opens on a walkway above the gate, which is 20 feet above ground level. The walkway is crenelated on both sides and wooden hoardings have been fitted to it.

When the castle is open for business, six hobgoblin archers are stationed in each tower to stand watch at the arrow slits and operate the drawbridge and porticullis as Ufthuk directs.

## Courtyard

The inner courtyard of the castle is the hub of activity under normal circumstances. It is a large, open court enclosed by the castle walls, bordered by stone buildings adjoining the walls, and crowded with timber frame cabins, except for a broad avenue down the center, a wide lane around the keep and a open area around a well in the southeast corner.

The timber cabins are barracks for the ogres. They are built on ogre scale, with wide doors and high ceilings. The roofs are timber framed and roofed in slate shingles, as are the other buildings in the courtyard. The doors are covered with thick hide flaps and the hearths are wide. These features are accommodations to the ogres' limited technical capacity.

The half-orcs and hobgoblin archers have their barracks in buildings along the walls. If alerted by the watchmen, all available troops will issue forth to their battle-stations along the walls.

4 Ogre Enforcers (Level 10 Brute)
16 Half-Orc Thugs (Level 7 Brute)
32 Hobgoblin Archers (Level 3 Artillery)

In normal circumstances, various craftsmen and merchants will be present in the court on business.

1d6 Hobgoblin Doxies (Level 3 Minion)

2d8 Goblin Craftsmen (Level 1 Minion)

1d6 Hobgoblin Merchants (Level 3 Minion)

On some occasions, an unusual visitor may be present in the court:

| -------- | --------- |
|      1-9 | None      |
|    10-12 | 1d6 Bugbears |
|    13-14 | 1d6 Duergar  | 
|    15-16 | Goblin Hexer/Underboss + 2d8 Goblin Blackblades/Warriors/Sharpshooters +1d4 Goblin Skullcleavers |
|    17-18 | Hobgoblin Commander/Warcaster/Hand of Akkar + 2d8 Hobgoblin Archers/Soldiers | 
|       19 | Exotic monster (Doppelganger/Hag/Ogre/Shifter) | 
|       20 | NPC monster (with entourage if appropriate) |

## North Tower

### North Tower Ground Floor (Level 1)

Outside the door to this tower, a small corral encloses part of the courtyard. On many nights, a black horse can be seen pacing back and forth within this enclosure. This is Qaetra 's nightmare mount, Shadowblaze, waiting to go out on a ride. The hell-horse, obedient to his mistresses' will, does not flame or show his true aspect while he waits here, but even the tough and thick-witted ogres have learned better than to come too close.

The door is sturdily built of oak with iron reinforcements and is protected by an iron portcullis. This and the iron bars over the arrow-slits give the tower the appearance of a prison. Like the corral, this security is actually intended to keep the ignorant away rather than to keep the occupants in.

The ground-floor chamber is cluttered with supplies, treasures and oddments of all kinds, all jumbled together in a frightful disarray. Just enough space has been kept clear to provide a path from the door to the bottom of the stone stairs that lead to the first floor. These goods are mostly bribes and kickbacks that Quetra has taken in exchange for exercising her influence with Gorbast on behalf of various parties.

### North Tower First Floor (Level 2)

Qetra is not really the stay-at-home-and-brew sort. She has no patience for cooking and cares little what she eats. To save time, she has food brought to her and may live for weeks on cheese and crusty bread. Her kitchen/dining room reflects this. The fireplace in the corner is kept going for heat, but the cooking racks above it are empty. Two cabinets on either side of the room are stocked with staples such as wheels of goat cheese, crocks of prepared foods, and leather sacks of hard bread. A cask in the corner contains agrash and a mug of it stands on the dining table along with the remains of the hag's most recent meal. 

### North Tower Second Floor (Level 3)

Qetra sleeps on this floor. Her needs are simple and the contents of her bedroom are spartan. There is a single mattress on the floor spread with goat's-wool blankets. Wood for the fire is stacked haphazardly along the west wall. The arrow-slits are covered with wooden shutters, which Qetra keeps closed and latched since she cannot abide the light of day and dislikes hearing the hubbub of the castle court beneath the south windows.

A large trunk along the east wall holds the hag's prized possessions. It is locked with an integrated lock (DC 17) and protected by a Glyph of Warding (fire). It contains:
* Helm of the Eagle
* Ritual book: Wizard's Sight, Arcane Lock, Discern Lies
* 1,200 GP in Telenar and South Kingdoms currencies
* 100 GP amber gemstone
* 120 GP moonstone gemstone 
* A piece of unworked nephrite jade worth 500 GP
Because she fears assassination, Qetra keeps an Eye of Alarm (Perception +14) set to announce “Mistress, you have visitors!” on seeing any creature larger than a rat. The eye is located in the center of the north wall.

### North Tower Third Floor (Level 4)

Qetra uses this room for study, meditation, research, and ritual casting. Qetra often sleeps in this room when she performs long rituals. She keeps a mattress spread with blankets of goat's-wool along the east wall of this room. Before going to sleep, she sets an Eye of Alarm like the one in her bedroom, but she often forgets to do this when she is particularly weary.

Hell Hag (Level 14 Solo Lurker) - Qetra

Like her sisters, Qetra carries a shard of the Eye of Shadow. This allows her to summon three wraiths, effectively granting them the following powers:

Summons to the Master (Teleportatlon) (At-Will, Move) Requirement: The master must be holding the ritual focus and issue the summons, which is a minor action. Effect: The wraith teleports to a square within 2 squares of the ritual focus. The wraith can be anywhere, even on another plane, when it answers the summons and needs not have line of sight to the ending square.
Shielding Shadows (At-Will, Immediate Interrupt) Requirement: The wraith must be adjacent to its master. Trigger: The wraith’s master takes damage. Effect: The wraith takes the damage instead of its master.
3 Wraiths (Level 5 Lurker)

Qetra is actually the mastermind behind Gorbast's rule. In her dealings in Delastarion, she usually assumes the form of a hobgoblin crone and goes under the name Medera. In this guise, she has the confidence of Zanatha the hobgoblin madame, Krunris the ogre shaman, and the matriarchs of most of the goblin tribes. She uses this influence to prop up Gorbast and outmaneuver his would-be rivals.

Inside the tower, Qetra dresses in black robes with a cowl that hides her face and gloves that hide her hands. She comes and goes at will between the North Tower and the Keep or between the castle and the town. She sets forth on her vicious black horse, vanishes into the wild for days or sometimes weeks, and then reappears unlooked-for. The consensus of rumor in the town is that the denizen of the North Tower is a wight-sorcerer left by the Red Sorcerers to serve as a backstop for Gorbast's rule.

Gorbast believes that he is his own master and that Qetra is only a useful ally, but in any significant matter he almost always finds himself seeking and following her advice. For her own part, Qetra has no taste for the mundane duties of administration and, as a female, would not be respected among the warriors of any of the monster races of Delastarion in any event. She is content to be the power behind the throne as she seeks to further the schemes of her coven and her own plans to be free of her pact. She sees many more possibilities here on the frontier and relishes her freedom to slip away with Shadowblaze and hunt down humanoids without fear of repercussion.

## Dungeon

### Keep Dungeon (Level -1)

A flight of steps from the ground floor leads down to the dungeon of the keep. Usually, Gorbast's enforcers issue summary judgement on lawbreakers, but when the boss wants to keep someone on ice, they are brought here. Clockwise starting at the stairs, the rooms and halls on this level are:

### Guard Hall

This hall is not usually occupied except when an especially dangerous prisoner is being kept or an execution or interrogation is impending. 

Ogre Enforcer (Level 10 Brute)
Half-Orc Thug (Level 7 Brute)
  
### Cell 1

A goblin slave merchant named Marulgrosh is being held here as part of a shakedown. He is well-connected with the Keledrash, a tribe of goblins that has territories in the mountains to the west. Gorbast's thugs roughed up the goblin, but he is not seriously hurt. They put him in this cell so that he can hear the screams from Arenor's torture, in the expectation that this will soften him up for further negotiations.

### Cell 2

Empty

### Cell 3

Arenor, the infamous were-rat rogue, is being kept in this cell. He was caught attempting to sneak into the keep disguised as one of the half-orcs (a goblin scullion slave named Mabdung sold him a password that turned out to have been outdated). He was looking for Gorbast's strongbox because he had been told that one of a duergar trade emissary had given the ogre boss a vial containing somethin extremely secret and highly valuable. Gorbast demanded to know Arenor's mission and, impatient with the rogue's increasingly transparent lies, ordered him to be tortured.

Wererat Infamous Rogue (Level 7 Solo Skirmisher) - Arenor

### Torture Chamber

This chamber is equipped with the usual devices for conducting harsh interrogations. It is being prepared for the inquisitor Thorgush to question Arenor. Thorgush dresses in black robes and wears a cloak of black wolf-skin. He views his duties as an act of worship to his dark gods and is the head of a secret cult that conducts abductions and murderous rituals in Goblintown. His two assistants are members of the cult a well.

Half-Orc Death Mage (Level 6 Controller) - Thorgush

2 Goblin Blackblades (Level 1 Lurker) - Assistants

### Cell 4

Empty

### Cell 5

This cell is occupied by Garredest, Arenor's partner in many of his adventures. After Arenor's arrest, Gorbast had Garredest rounded up and brought here to be cross-interrogated so as to expose any holes in Arenor's story. He has already been tormented once and his fingers are broken. He told all he knows, but it didn't satisfy Thorgush since Arenor had not intended to let Garredest in on the caper until he knew what Gorbast's secret was. The inquisitor is keeping Garredest alive in case further questions should arise.

Wererat Assassin (Level 7 Elite Skirmisher) - Garredest

### Cell 6

Empty. There is a secret door (Perception DC 28 to find; Thievery DC 22 to open) behind the pallet in this room. It leads to the stairway to the emergency exit.

### Emergency Exit

A long stairway leads to a passage that opens on a chamber. The door in the east wall of this chamber leads to a ledge in the cliff beneath the keep, overlooking the river. A series of stairways and ledges cleverly lead down to within 10 feet of the level of the riverbank. Their clever construction and a number of strategically-placed bushes and shrubs conceals the existence of the secret exit (Perception DC 28 to find from the riverbank).

## Ground Floor

### Keep Ground Floor (Level 1)

The ground floor of the keep is the first level of the keep's dungeon. It is not accessible from the outside, only from the stairs leading down from the keep's first floor.
There are four chambers on this floor that open onto a long hallway that runs along the inside wall of the keep. These chambers are used for storage of various supplies that would be needed during a siege. The wide hall at the north end of the floor serves as an armory. Racks lining the south wall of this hall hold pole-arms, axes, crossbows and many sheafs of bolts. The crossbows in particular are well-made, being the work of duergar armorers.

## First Floor

### Keep First Floor (Level 2)

A set of basalt steps are built up against the green stone foundations of the keep. They lead to a landing before an archway in which is set a thick, iron-reinforced door protected by a portcullis. An iron-grated peephole is set in each of the two halves of the door. During normal business hours, the porticullis is raised, but the door is kept barred.

### Vestibule

This chamber is most notable for the basalt archways that open on it from all sides. The stonework is craftsman-like, but plain except for a band of carving above the west archway, which reads "The King Reigns Where His Subjects Dwell". This has been much chipped and defaced, but is still legible. The windlass for the portcullis is set in the east wall. A thoroughly mudstained, worn and bedraggled carpet covers much of the center of the floor. Its original color might have been red.

The ceiling is 12 feet high at the center of the room and a chandelier made of stag-horns hangs from an iron chain at its center. At night, this is lit with poor-quality tallow candles that have stained the ceiling above them black with soot.
A half-orc door-warden is on duty here at all times. He will question any visitors who arrive at the door and will only admit them if they are expected. The door-warden will be businesslike, if not as curt as Ufthuk. He can be confident because he has several ogres at his call in the adjoining rooms.

The archway on the south opens to the landing of the stairs leading down to the ground floor (Level 1).

Half-Orc Thug (Level 7 Brute)

### Reception Chamber

This chamber has been converted to a guardroom. It is usually occupied by two ogres of Gorbast's bodyguard unless they have been called away elsewhere (for example, to the antechamber). They generally sit at ease in the northwest and southeast corners of the room. A large iron brazier in the northeast corner of the room provides heat and light. This is not really optimal for defense, as the brazier would need to be moved to allow defenders to access the arrow slit in the north wall. A hogshead of weak beer stands between the arrow-slits on the east wall -- one of the perks of the job.

2 Ogre Enforcers (Level 10 Brute)

### Meeting Chamber

This chamber is now a bunk-room for two more ogres, the remaining compliment of Gorbast's bodyguard. When not on duty, they sleep here on piles of noisome, verminous hides in the north and south corners of the room. The floor is littered with rubbish and filth of various sorts and the whole area is choked with the stench of it.

2 Ogre Enforcers (Level 10 Brute)

### Antechamber

This room is sparsely furnished. A large cherry-wood table of colonial design stands along the north wall, flanked by two standing candelabra of wrought iron. On the north wall, above the table, hangs a crude banner of elkhide on which is painted Gorbast's personal design, a clutching blue hand with sharp red nails.

When expected visitors arrive, Gorbast's lieutenant Andgrash will greet them in this room accompanied by one of the ogre guards from the Vestibule. The two will escort the visitors upstairs.

## Second Floor

### Keep Second Floor (Level 3)

The stairs from the first floor lead up to a landing that opens on a wide hallway. The ceiling on this level is not quite as high as on the first floor, but it is still 10 feet high.

### Stairway Chamber

A set of wide, wooden stairs leads up to the third floor (Level 4). Like the timbers and floors of the room above, these were burned in the fall of Delastarion and have been rebuilt with rough, thick timber designed to bear the weight of ogres.

### Great Hall

This large chamber is the keep's great hall. Gorbast receives visitors and supplicants here and uses it when he hosts feasts. Two large windows are set in the wall at either end of the hall. Their glass panes have been replaced by sturdy iron bars with wrought-iron spikes that are part design and part protection. There are fixed in place and heavy wooden shutters on the outside can be closed at need.

Several sturdy wooden tables, some ogre-sized and some not, stand in various parts of the room. These will be occupied by various parties of guests and their guards of honor, depending on the circumstances:

d20 RollEncounter1-5
Goblin Underboss + Goblin Hexer + 1d6 Goblin Skullcleavers
6-9
Barghest Battle Lord + Hobgoblin Warcaster + 1d4 Hobgoblin Soldiers

Orc Chieftain + Orc Eye of Ugrush + 1d6 Orc Raiders 
19Ogre Storm Shaman + Ogre Ironclad 20Pact Hag + Werewolf + 1d4 Shifter Longtooth Hunter

Gorbast keeps his bodyguard, Thock, with him at all times. Thock is simple-mindedly loyal to his master and is used to thrashing anything that Gorbast sets him on. For these reasons, Thock might easily fight to the death to protect Gorbast without really meaning to.

Ogre Warhulk (Level 11 Elite Brute) - Thock

Oni Overlord (Level 12 Elite Brute - Leader) - Gorbast

### Armory Chamber

Gorbast had the armory chamber fitted with stout steel bars to serve as a cage for his pet dire bear, Unzi. The bear generally rests in a pile of straw in the southeast corner of the room. It is tame with Gorbast (as much as such a creature can be), but it will obey only simple handling commands ("back" and "down") from him. An old goblin named Hrangash raised Unzi from a cub and trained him. The bear loves Hrangash and will obey additional commands from him ("stay", "up", "dance" and "kill"). Gorbast bought Unzi from Hrangash and paid the goblin to be his trainer. However, Gorbast feared that an enemy might someday bribe Hrangash to use his control over the bear to aid an assassination. Gorbast tried to have Hrangash killed, but the wily old goblin got wind of it and skipped town.

Dire Bear (Level 11 Elite Brute)

The arrow-slits of this room are fitted with wrought-iron grilles identical to the ones that protect Gorbast's chambers. This is because the work was performed at the same time, but it has the effect of confusing the question of which chambers are Gorbast's from outside.

### Keep Third Floor (Level 4)

The stairs from the second floor lead up to a landing that opens on a wide hallway. The ceiling on this level is 10 feet high.

### The Living Chamber

This chamber in the southeast corner of this level of the keep was once the main living area of the marshall and his family. It serves as a main hallway and occasional dining room for Gorbast. It has only a large table and a few chairs, some large and some normal-sized, for furniture. Its sole decoration is a tapestry looted from one of the buildings in town. The tapestry is the work of weavers in the Southern Kingdoms. It depicts a jungle scene filled with exotic plants, birds and animals. One prominent feature is of a gigantic eagle bearing an elephant away in its talons. The tapestry is some the worse for wear, but Gobast keeps it because it reminds him of his home in Undenar.

### The Kitchen

This chamber has retained its traditional use as a kitchen. Gorbast keeps several goblin slaves as cooks and personal servants. The kitchen is their headquarters.

6 Goblin Warriors (Level 1 Skirmishers)

The goblin slaves are the pick of the slave markets, so they are hardier than usual. They are unarmed, but there are ample improvised weapons available in the kitchen, should they have to defend themselves. The slaves accept their lot as part of the natural order of things. They are even proud of the fact that their master is the effective ruler of Delastarion.

### The Master Bedchamber

This is Gorbast's sleeping chamber. The doors to this chamber are stout wood reinforced with iron. They can be barred from within. Gorbast always bars the door when he is on his way to bed. His huge bed occupies the entire west end of the room. The arrow-slits in this room and its adjoining chambers are fitted with stout grilles of wrought iron set directly into the surrounding stone. This compromises the keep's defense, but Gorbast considers it necessary to his personal safety.

### The Toilet

This room was originally divided into several chambers, one of which was the toilet. For Gorbast's use, this room has been converted to a single combination toilet/washroom/walk-in closet. An ogre-sized commode stands along the west wall and a large table on the south wall holds a large copper wash basin. Standing next to this is a barrel of water with a wooden lid and a large ladle. Also on the south wall there is a chest that holds Gorbast's spare clothes. On the opposite wall, a rack holds the ogre's spare weapons and other sundries.

### The Strong-Room

Gorbast keeps his personal valuables here. The door to the room is made of sturdy oak sheathed in iron. It is locked with two large padlocks (DC 20 each) locked into hasps near the top and bottom of the right side of the door and a dwarven lock (DC 32) set into the center of the door surrounded by a six-spoked handle. Gorbast keeps the keys to these on his person at all time. The threshold before the door is trapped with a pressure plate that triggers poisoned-dart traps in the indicated squares in front of the door. The traps will also fire if the door is opened from the right side after the padlocks are removed. It is meant to open from the opposite side using the padlock hasps as hinges:

Incendiary Dart Wall (Level 10 Elite Blaster)
Trap XP 500
A shaped charge hidden in the wall explodes, filling the chamber with small darts that ignite as they fly.
Trap: The trap fires a barrage of incendiary fletchettes that attack the targets in the blast. There are three charges, each of which has its own blast area. Creatures in a square where two blast areas overlap will be subject to two attacks. 
Perception
DC 26: The character notices the panels in the walls that conceal the shaped charges.
DC 28: The character notices the pressure-plate trigger.
DC 30: The character notices that the padlock hasps are actually designed to act as hinges.
DC 26: The character notices that what appears to be a cudgel on the weapons rack is actually a lever.
Trigger
When a character steps on the pressure plate square or opens the door from the wrong side, the trap attacks.
Attack
Standard Action Close Blast 3 
Targets: Creatures in blast
Attack: +15 vs. AC
Hit: 4d8+5 damage and ongoing 10 fire damage (save ends).
Miss: Half damage and ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).
Countermeasures
An adjacent character can disable the pressure plate with a DC 26 Thievery check.
An adjacent character can disable one of the shaped charges with a DC 28 Thievery check.
An adjacent character can disable the door trigger with a DC 30 Thievery check.
A character who has discovered the lever on the weapons rack can simply pull it down, disabling the pressure plate. However, the door trigger will remain active.
Gorbast commissioned this trap from duergar artisans, which explains its high level of craftsmanship and lethality.

On the floor is a strong-box made of iron and locked with a large padlock (DC 25). Gorbast keeps the key hidden under a loose brick in the hearth (DC 23 to locate). The chest is not trapped. Inside are the following treasures:
* 1,200 GP
* Magic wand +3 (Lvl 11)
* Fire opal worth 1000 GP
* Vial of 3 oz. of black igneous ore bearing 11.2 grains (224 mites, 0.0256 oz.) of mithril worth 800 GP
* 

### Keep Fourth Floor (Level 5)

This floor was formerly the ladies' residence, but it is now a barracks for Gorbast's half-orc guards.

### The Starway Hall

This hall serves as a guardroom and armory. On the west wall between the two heavy timber staircases there is a rack of weapons (duergar-made crossbows, bolts, axes, flails and shields) for use by the keep's defenders. An archway in the east wall opens on a balcony that serves as a machicolation defending the stairway to the keep's main door. This is ordinarily closed off by two sturdy iron-reinforced wooden doors barred from the inside (DC 25 to open from outside).

Two half-orcs generally stand guard here, but their discipline is not up to hobgoblin military standards:

d20 RollResult1Both guards are absent2-3One guard is absent4-19Both guards are present20The guards have been joined by another monster

2 Half-Orc Thugs (Level 7 Brute)

### The North Hall

This hall is used by the half-orc guards as a break-room and dining hall. Unless there are unusual circumstances, four of them will be enjoying a hot meal and a cold mug of agrash at the table on the north wall. Among these is a death mage, one of a small number of half-orcs who use magic.

3 Half-Orc Thugs (Level 7 Brute)
Half-Orc Death Mage (Level 6 Controller)

### The Barracks Room

This common-room is the quarters of the half-orc guards. The floors by the walls are lined with their sleeping pads (mostly unkempt piles of hides and straw-stuffed deerskin matresses). An iron stove connected to the chimney on the south wall provides heat during the chill months.

In normal circumstances, there will be three off-shift guards sleeping in this room.

3 Half-Orc Thugs (Level 7 Brute)

The Store-Room

This room is filled with goods and supplies of all kinds -- everything from cheeses to sacks of tubers to lantern oil.

The Gallery Hall

This wide hall is unused, except for access to the Store-Room.

### Keep Fifth Floor (Level 6)

This is the top level of the keep. It consists of a walkway around the walls with a rectangular turret-house rising from the center. The roof-house is roofed with timber and slate.

### The Wyvern-Roost

This room is large and mostly empty. The chimney on the west wall provides some heat. There are piles of stones along the west wall, stored here as missles for use during a siege.

The roof-house is the roost of a wyvern that is the personal mount of a mercenary scout in Gorbast's employ, a catlike female shifter named Leandryss. The creature is quite vicious with anyone but its master and the half-orc guards know that to enter this room without her would be courting death. This could possibly be a weak point in the keep's defense, since the guards could not get to the supply of stones in Leandryss' absence.

### The Stair Chamber

The stairs end in an empty chamber. A weapons rack on the west wall holds duergar-made crossbows and quivers of bolts.
