# Setup

## Cast of Characters

### Master Quin Liu

Wizard (5th level). Neutral Good. The Juchin master of a troupe of shadow-puppet performers who are all orphans he has adopted. He scouts for street urchins who may have magical talent and trains them in the arcane arts.

### Yasreena

Commoner. Chaotic Neutral. An exotic dancer and opportunistic thief. Alluring and impulsive with a flair for the dramatic. Driven to make her fortune while her looks last.

### Belshar bal-Asram

Noble. Neutral. Owns copper mines in the eastern mountains. His workers breached a cave that opened on an ancient temple dedicated to a winged serpent deity. They made off with some gold and jade ornaments and came to gruesome ends. The main temple still lies behind a stone door sealed with arcane symbols spelling out curses on anyone who defiles it. Belshar intends to plunder the temple, but he needs to find out how to neutralize the curse. He also has snake cultists trying to assassinate him.

### Nasaam

Commoner. Neutral. Belshar's manservant.

### Daneema

Commoner. Neutral. Belshar's housekeeper.

### Mother Saloma

Green Hag. She disguises herself as an old crone fortuneteller.

### Azriss

Yuan-ti Pureblood. A snake cult assassin. Bald-headed and black-eyed. Wears a cloak with a cowl to conceal the scales which cover the back of his head, neck, and shoulders.
 

## Plot

Yasreena is Belshar's mistress. He secretly keeps a small house in the city where he can conduct his affairs out of sight of his wives. They have their assignations there, coming and going separately with their identities hidden.

Belshar was in possession of a jade bracelet carved in the shape of a serpent that came from the temple. He hid it in the small house since he thinks that no one knows of his association with it. Yasreena found out about it. Later, she misread Belshar's preoccupation as intent to drop her and stole the bracelet in a fit of pique.

Yasreena had no idea where the bracelet came from. She showed it to a fortuneteller woman who told her it was cursed. The fortuneteller told her that if she gives it back to Belshar, the curse won't stick to her. This is a problem, because she is afraid that if she admits she stole the bracelet, Belshar will actually cut her off. So she hit on the idea of having someone else take the bracelet back secretly, in the hope that he will not yet have missed it.

The snake cult was interested when artifacts sacred to their cult started showing up on the market. They tracked down one of Belshar's workers and extracted the story of the desecration of their ancient temple. They then tracked down the others and tortured and killed them one by one. This led them to Belshar, who is out of town. They broke into his house, but could not find the bracelet. So they terrorized his servants to keep up the appearance of normalcy and left an assassin to take care of him when he returns.

## Hook

Yasreena knows the adventurers. She tells them that she stole the bracelet on a whim, but found out later that it was a favorite of his chief wife, which he was going to get repaired in the city. She says that she is afraid that if he finds out, he really will cut her off. She promises them money and favors if they return the bracelet in a way that Belshar doesn't know that it was missing.

There is a large copper pot on a swing in the fireplace. A large urn for water stands in the northeast corner. A large knife and a clay pitcher and platter are on the preparation table in the southeast corner along with a clay tray of mushrooms and shallots. DC 15 Wisdom(Preception) check to notice that these have been there for at least a day. A set of shelves holds normal implements such as forks and ladles and a number of small boxes and clay pots of various spices.

An urn in the northwest corner holds cooking oil.

A curtain covers the door to the servant's chamber. The door has a latch, but no lock. It is closed.

### Servant's Chamber

Nasaam lives here as a full-time caretaker and butler. Daneema normally comes in during the days to clean and cook, but goes to her own home before sunset. DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) to have it occur that the fact that both of them are together in this room after hours is unusual. After dark, the room will be lit by the two hooded lanterns, one on the bedside table and the other on the low table. DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) to notice that what appears to be a tattoo that covers the back of his head and neck is actually a patch of fine scales in black, yellow, and red.

Azriss sits on the cushion in front of the low table. He wears a blousy white shirt, open at the chest, and a pair of trousers striped in colors to match his scales. He pays no attention to the book open on the table, but instead faces the door. His unsheathed scimitar lies close at hand on the table and he is additionally armed with four throwing-knives in a bandolier across his chest. His brown hooded cloak is draped across the top of the chest in the southeast corner that contains Nasaam's wardrobe.

Nassam and Daneema sit on the single bed rather uncomfortably. Both are dressed in simple peasant garb. Azriss has instructed Nassam to answer the door. If it is their master, Nassam is to offer the usual greeting and Daneema is to join him in the main room. The two are to bid their master to lie on the couch while they fetch him refreshments from the kitchen. The servants are to admit no one else and are to give no hint that there is anything wrong. Azriss has, of course, threatened them with death if they do not comply and has made a point of casually flicking knives into the door across the room to let them know he is capable of carrying out this threat.

## The Empty Flat

After their raid on Belshar's love nest, the adventurers are dismayed to discover that Yasreena is not to be found. All anyone can tell them is that she was suddenly called for a private performance and will no doubt be home by the afternoon of the next day.

If the characters think to visit Yasreena's flat and ask her womanservant, Racheel, she will tell them that her mistress got a message that she was wanted to perform at a private party hosted by Anwal bal-Mezzah, a wealthy arms merchant, left hastily, and has not been home since.

The next day, the adventurers will hear that Belshar bal-Asram's body was found in the Ghalez river. The reports are that he had been tortured with a knife and killed by evisceration. They will still be unable to find Yasreena, and her maid will report that she has not been home.

The following day, rumors will surface that Nasaam and Daneema, were found murdered in the small house. Since their employment to Belshar was secret, no one will link their deaths to Belshar's murder or Yasreena's disappearance. If the adventurers visit Yasreena's flat, they will find that no one is home. Racheel too has disappeared and the apartment has been ransacked.

A search of the flat will reveal the following:

* DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) - The contents of chests and drawers have been dumped out and rifled, but among these are valuable items that a thief would surely have taken.  
* DC 15 Intelligence(Investigation) - There are no signs of violence or a struggle.  
* DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) - Although a number of valuable items were left behind, none of Yasreena's signature possessions are here.  
* DC 10 Wisdom(Perception) - Among the scattered possessions are a censor that still holds several half-burnt incense sticks. Nearby is a packet of incense sticks bound together with a piece of papyrus, on which is stamped in green ink a symbol of an eye within a heart.
* DC 15 Wisdom(Urban Survival) - The symbol on the incense is the trademark of Mother Saloma. She sells bundles of incense such as this to her customers in specific formulations according to her diagnosis of their spiritual problems.
* DC 20 Intelligence(Arcana) - The incense has a strong odor of galangal, which is used to break curses.

## The Fortuneteller

Mother Saloma keeps a small apartment above a former apothecary's shop that is now an opium den in a seedy part of town. A small wooden sign near the stairs that bears her trademark is the only advertising she needs. Mostly, people seek her out deliberately.

The front room of the apartment is separated from the back rooms by a faded brocade curtain that covers an inner curtain of amber and mahogany beads. Most of the floor space is occupied by a battered, red-lacquered table surrounded by musty cushions that might once have been green and blue-striped. The walls are lined with cabinets and shelves stocked with a riot of strange curios, dusty tomes, jars of grey-brown fluid which hint at repulsive contents, and small pots and vials of every description. The rafters are hung with bunches of dried herbs. A mangy-looking taxidermied monkey grins evilly from the top of a bookcase. This last article is particularly unsettling because, although you never see it move, it always seems to be in a slightly different pose each time you look back at it after looking away.

The hag disguises herself with _illusory appearance_, but her choice of illusionary appearances is far from comely. She favors appearing as a grossly-overweight old woman dressed in a faded and dirty, but still gaudy, wrapper-dress. Her hair is an uncombed grey mop, and her brown skin is dry and dull as though she were covered in dust. The gold ring through her nose is more reminiscent of a pig than of any feminine adornment. A large, dark mole grows on her chin, along with random wispy hairs. She smiles often, typically in an unpleasant manner, displaying large gaps and the stumps of broken teeth amoung a few discolored sound ones.

Mother Saloma adopts this disguise so as to stay in the thick of the population, rather than at its fringes. As a fortuneteller, people expect her to be bizarre and unsavory. In this guise, she has boundless opportunities to corrupt, betray, and devour the vulnerable with little risk to herself. In fact, Saloma has become so sated that she occasionally takes a fancy to someone and is genuinely helpful to that person, with no thought of advantage to herself. This favor, of course, cannot be relied on, but it was in such a mood that she warned Yasreena of the aura of evil and tragedy she sensed in the jade bracelet and gave her some sticks of incense along with the sound advice to get rid of the thing as soon as possible.

If the adventurers track down Mother Saloma, she will initially be well-disposed toward them and may very well inform them of her dealings with Yasreena for a nominal fee of 10 SP. She will, of course, pump them for information on her own account and may well foster a relationship with them in order to turn them to evil. For example, if the characters press her on Yasreena's well-being, she may say that she can attempt to contact her in the spirit world, and in that way discern whether she is dead. In this case, Saloma will claim that she needs the finger-bone of a woman less than a week dead. She has no such power and needs no such thing, but grave-robbery is a gateway to the ever more evil deeds Saloma will demand in exchange for her help in the future.

## The Seeker

When the adventurers go home, a close associate will tell them that a man wearing a dark brown hooded cloak came by a few hours earlier and asked questions about someone matching their descriptions. The associate will remember little of the man's appearance, except to say that the stranger had yellowish skin and eyes so black that they seemed to have no pupil. This, of course, was Azriss, who observed the character's visit to Yasreena's flat, but did not follow them immediately because he thought he might find Yasreena, or even the bracelet, there. When he was disappointed on both accounts, he kidnapped Racheel and took her to another location where he tortured her for information. This led him to Anwal bal-Mezzah's mansion, but finding it well-guarded, he set other snake-cultists to watch it and picked up on the trail of the adventurers.

## The Mansion

Anwal bal-Mezza, a **noble**, lives in a luxurious manision that is guarded around the clock by four **guards** commanded by a **veteran**. He is attended by 8 **commoners**, two wives, a concubine, three maidservants, and two manservants.

Two human snake-cult **cultists** disguised as street workers watch the mansion.

Anwal has hired Yasreena to dance at parties in the past, but he did not send the message that called her to his mansion. He will be disinclined to waste time seeing anyone who comes seeking Yasreena (she's nothing to him). Even if questioned, he can offer little information other than to deny that he ever called for Yasreena. He will scoff at suggestions that he is in danger.

If the adventurers do visit Anwal, the snake-cultists will observe this and will conclude that he may have the bracelet. Azriss will appear at the mansion with the two **acolytes** disguised as private guards, claiming to have business with Anwal. His real objective will be to provoke Anwal's guard to call their captain to decide whether to admit him. Once the captain comes out to speak with him, Anwal will use _suggestion_ to persuade him that the adventurers are involved in a plot to rob the mansion and that he would earn his master's praise if he took two of his men out that night to track the adventurers down and roughly dissuade them from the attempt. This will leave only two guards in the mansion when Azriss leads four **cultists** in a raid with the objective of kidnapping Anwal so that he can be tortured into revealing the whereabouts of the bracelet.

## The Pilgrims

Belshar sent Yasreena the summons to Anwal's mansion, but intercepted her disguised as a beggar and persuaded her to flee with him. They are currently staying at an inn near the harbor, disguised as pilgrims waiting to embark on a ship to the city-state of Masheer, an important religious center in the worship of Yshma, the Sea Goddess.

## The Cremation-Grounds

One of the ways that the adventusers might find the finger-bone of a woman dead for no more than a week is to make a visit to the cremation-grounds north of the city near the western bank of the Ghales river. Poor people often cannot afford enough wood to fully cremate a departed relative and sometimes even throw the body on someone else's pyre. For this reason, half-burned corpses are a common sight. These attract carrion-eaters such as wild dogs, vultures, crocodiles, and even ghouls. As a result, the cremation-grounds are a dangerous to be after dark.

## The Harem Raid

Mother Saloma has a customer who is in love with another man's wife, a pleasingly-plump woman named Sharazeen. Unfortunately for the would-be lover, Sharazeen is a virtuous woman and her husband, a harbor-tax assessor named Gerzered, is wealthy enough to afford guards for his harem. Sharazeen and her older sister-wife, Nafalshee, seldom leave Gerzered's mansion, except for a weekly trip to the market at the Cistern of the Seven Brides to buy danties, especially a confection of candied dates and honey called _harkala_, of which Sharazeen is exceedingly fond. The hag has promised her client to produce a love charm of surpassing potency with which he can seduce the fair Sharazeen, but she needs a body part, such as a lock of hair, to work the spell. She may bargain with the adventurers to obtain this.

## The Dark Relic

Mother Saloma has a long-outstanding contract to inflict a curse on House Dahai, a noble house of Nashal. Recently, she has acquired a convenient means to fulfill this obligation. An ancient relic, the thigh-bone of an infamous lich named Arkraz Khalharzra, came into her possession as part of a bargain. Among its other properties, the necrotic influence of this relic can cause dead humanoids in its proximity to rise as undead of various sorts. Mother Saloma needs someone to take the relic to Nashal and conceal it within the bal-Mahabram mausoleum, in the expectation that the family's reputation will suffer when its deceased members make a nuisance of themselves.
