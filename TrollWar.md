**War Trolls** are trolls specially bred for size and intelligence and given martial training and superior armor and weapons. Their intelligence and training tempers the war trolls' unpredictable nature, but does little to curb their appetite for slaughter and plunder. If anything, war trolls are even greedier for treasure than their wild kindred since they are more aware of the pleasures that riches can buy. Also unlike their uncouth cousins, war trolls are deadly at range. They wield powerful longbows of hollow steel that few men could even bend. Some war trolls even carry ballistas into battle for use against fortifications and enemy troops alike.
