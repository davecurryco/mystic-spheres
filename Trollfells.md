# The Trollfells

As they travel from west to east from the Celadonnin River, the adventurers will pass through light forest of beech and ash into low hills separated by many little valleys through which run creeks and small streams that drain away southwest. The hills will gradually give way to high ridges and bluffs above moorlands of heather and bracken interspersed with small, blighted, black pines. In time, the party will come to a country of high, barren hills and mesas. These are the Trollfells, of evil repute.
