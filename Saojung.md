# Saojung

Saojung is a seaport city that is famous both as a pilgrimage site and as the location of the most septic slum in Khanashar. As in Khanenghul, a Juchin minority governs a population of Khemez farmers and fisherfolk, but here in Saojung, the stratification between the two ethnicities is more rigid due to a caste system held over from the days of the Azruun Empire. 

## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Governorship

The _Mughad_ governor who rules Saojung on behalf of the Shan of Khanashar is more firmly in control of the apparatus of state than is typical of governors in other parts of Khanengul. Only in Saojung does the governor command the city guard and have the power to veto appointments of _Wajeer_ ministers. This is the legacy of a violent uprising among the Khemez some generations ago that had to be suppressed by troops loyal to the Shan.

## Religion

**Majority Religion:** Yshma

Since the days of the Old Kingdom, Saojung has been the center of worship of Yshma, the Sea Goddess. Not only is she universally venerated among the Khemez fisherfolk of Saojung, but pilgrims come from all the coastal cities of Khanashar and Pashan to pay homage to the goddess and consult her oracles at the famous Grottos of Communion. The Juchin merchants and traders of Saojung also worship Kublai, the Merchant God, while government officials and the military venerate Tamirz. An underground cult of Shrivra based in Saojung operates among the Khemez traders and porters who ply the roads between Khanengul and Baimin.
