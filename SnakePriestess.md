**Conjure Serpents** As an action, the snake priestess can summon fey spirits that take the form of snakes. The priestess can summon one giant constrictor snake, eight poisonous snakes, or a swarm of poisonous snakes. The summoned creatures appear in unoccupied spaces that the priestess can see within 60 feet. Alternately, the priestess can summon two deadly venomous snakes, which appear in her hands and with which she can attack as if they were weapons. The summoned creatures are friendly to the priestess and her allies and obey her verbal commands. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. The summoned creatures disappear after 10 minutes or when the priestess takes an action to dismiss them.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The snake priestess makes two poisonous snake attacks.

**Poisonous Snake.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Hypnotic Dance.** The snake priestess performs a swaying, seductive dance. Each humanoid within 60 feet who sees the dance must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Male humanoids have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed as long as the priestess dances, up to 1 minute. While charmed by the dance, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone e1se uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

**Snake Priestesses** are devotees of serpent godesses who are granted snake familiars with which they can attack as though the creatures were weapons. They make a weapon of the instinctive fear of snakes that most humanoids are subject to.
