| ----- | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| Rashazer | Rashazer schemes to revive the Azruun race and resume their conquest of all Arestor. | Rashazer aided Barazan in his rise to preminence, but he intends to betray the Emperor in the end and make the hobgoblins his slaves. | Rashazar enticed Varog to come to Arestor to distract the elves at his border, but he does not fully appreciate the intelligence and ambitions of dragonkind. |
| Barazan | The Emperor sees Rashazer as a useful counselor and ally, but he does not fully trust him. | Barazan seeks to consolidate his grip on Beranur, and expand his empire west into the lands of the elves and humans. | Barazan does not trouble himself about the dragon, since she seems content to trouble the elves. |
| Varog | Varog is aware that Rashazer is a powerful sorceror, but she does not know his plans. | The dragon cares little about the hobgoblins at this point, except as future prey. | Varog schemes to secretly establish her brood on Arestor. All other creatures are to become their slaves or their prey. |
