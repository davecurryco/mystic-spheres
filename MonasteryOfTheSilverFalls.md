# The Monastery of the Silver Falls

At a place called the Silver Falls, disciples of _Tanu_, the Juchin mystery religion, have established an isolated monastery. Although they live simple lives, the monks guard treasures of great value, some apparent, some hidden, and some disguised as ordinary objects or even creatures.

Jaman Khal has need of one of these treasures, a silver carp, and has sent the adventurers to fetch it. The carp is the key to the monastery's prosperity and Jaman intends to ransom it back to the monastery in exchange for the resurrection of Mulao. Jaman has assigned his apprentice to periodically scry the party and pick them up once it seems that they have accomplished their mission.

## General Features

Tanu is generally lawful neutral in its tenents, but high-level initiates often consider themselves to be above conventional morality. Although they are supposed to be celibate and unworldly, Tanu monks are frequently lustful and corrupt in secret.

## The Village of Gomai

_Map: Dodecahedron 2014 - Upper Bellem Village (page 23)_

At the mouth of the rill, a village called _Gomai_ caters to travelers. It is populated mainly by Khemez, but the businesses are mostly run by Juchin.

The main road to the village becomes a well-trodden path up the rill on the south side of a stream.

**Inn:** Phoenix of the Fortunate Dawn Inn (Medium), Proprietor: Gerghar Arkan (M, 42, Juchin, commoner, Greed, Brave, Ungainly)

The Phoenix was the first inn to be opened in Gomai. Arkan only keeps the property up as he must, but it has not yet fallen into disrepair. The rooms are comfortable, but there are few private rooms, as most of the space is taken up by two large common-rooms.

Arkan is grasping and miserly. He is in the business to get rich and he doesn't mind taking risks that he thinks might add to his wealth. He is physically and socially awkward, so he usually has a servant greet guests.

**Inn:** The Three Pomegranates of Celestial Delight (Medium), Proprieteress: Jeong Jinlau (F, 34, Juchin, commoner, Acceptance, Derisive, Poised)

Jinlau is a former courtesan from Khanengul who opened the Pomegranates with seed money from a wealthy patron after concluding that her background would bar her ambitions of social stature in the city. Even in Gomai, she strives for influence. Although she presents a cool and composed persona, her frustration bubbles to the surface in a certain edge to her tongue and in her habit of seducing handsome younger men.   

**Merchant:** Treasures of the Holy Sages (Books and maps, mundane, Poor), Proprietor: Kurdu Kolang (M, 36, Juchin, commoner, Friendship, Reverent, Slender)

Kolang studied in Banmai, but failed his examinations and was denied employment in the bureaucracy. He found his way to Gomai and opened this small shop, but still fancies himself to be a scholar of religion. There are few scrolls or books available in such an out-of-the-way place, so he mostly sells parchment and writing supplies to pilgrims who leave written prayers folded and stuffed into cracks in the waterfall cliff. He also does a fair amount of trade with the monastery and often befriends young acolytes.

One of the items available for sale in this shop is a copy of a scroll that circulates among the acolytes of the monastery. It gives practical advice -- including a simple hand-drawn map with annotations revealing the secret path on the north side of the waterfall pool and the use that the monks make of it.

**Merchant:** Souveniers of the Silver Stream (Knick-knacks, Excellent), Proprietor: Falesh Hardaz (M, 45, Alhrain, commoner, Greed, Sad, Loose)

Falesh is from Basrul, where he spends half of the year in the bazaar purchasing knick-knacks wholesale. In late spring, he travels to Gomai and opens up his shop to serve the yearly influx of pilgrims. He makes a great deal of money at this, but he is never satisfied. A tragedy in his past (the death of a precious child due to inability to buy healing) has given him a perpetually sad and gloomy disposition. The hardships of his travels have left him with little regard for personal decorum.

**Merchant:** Essences of the Healing Gardens (Potions, poisons, and herbs, Good), Proprietor: Amesh Vinasau (M, 68, Khemez, commoner, Experimentation, Brave, Healthy)

Amesh looks much younger and healthier than his years would indicate, the result of a draught from an antique bottle he bought in a bazaar when he was in his twenties. The same sense of curiosity and courage to try new things drives him still. He stocks his shop with wares purchased in Khanengul through an agent, which means that he seldom acquires rare items.

**Brothel:** Emperor's Best Harem Happy Massage (Brothel, Good), Proprieteress Chaulang Jinshin (F, 48, Juchin, commoner, Justice, Reflective, Old Fashioned)

Jinshin is a jaded whore, but she cherishes the traditions of the Juchin aristocracy in Khanengul where she grew up. She wears the elaborate court gowns and hairdress styles of a generation ago and holds to traditional notions of honor. Even in her heyday, she was never particularly attractive and she looks every part a matron of her age. She spends her mornings in quiet contemplation over a pot of tea and a bowl of opium in the garden of her house and arrives at the brothel at noon to ensure that preparations for the evening's revels are proceeding on schedule.

There are at least four eunuch **thugs** in Jinshin's employ on the premises at any given time. In the evenings, there will be 3d6 prostitutes and 2d6 customers will arrive in each 2-hour period.

**Rumors:**

* The cliff over which the falls run is riddled with veins of pure silver, which imparts a healing quality to the water.
* The monastery is built over the mouths of tunnels of silver mines.
* The head monk is the reincarnation of the revered sage Tiamar Dhanbai, who lived more than a century ago.
* The monks keep fantastic wealth hidden in their monastery -- including life-sized jade statues of courtesans that come to life on full-moon nights.
* The monks breed blind white carp in the cave from which the falls issue. Each carp holds a ghost who the monks have bound to the fish to keep the ghosts from doing mischief. Anyone who eats one of these carp will fall victim to a wasting sickness and become a ghost themselves.


#### People

**Elder:** Narhal Murthan (M, 36, Khemez, commoner, Revenge, Solemn, Dainty)

Narhal is rather young for an elder, as he inherited the commission from his father, who was murdered by practitoners of thugee while returning from Khanengul. Narhal is physically unimpressive and has an effete air, but he is resourceful and determined, even grim in pursuing worshipers of Shrivra.

**Magistrate:** Maodung Malang (M, 32, Juchin, commoner, Fear, Loyalty, Handsome)

Malang is also young for his post. His family's long loyalty to a faction of Khanengul's Darban secured him this appointment after he passed his examinations, but he was never a particularly clever student and he is afraid that his lack of acumen will show. Consequently, says little from the bench and applies himself to courting favor with his patrons. He is good-looking for a magistrate too, although he is uncommonly faithful to his wife.

**City Guard Captain:** Mutaal Narayan (M, 50, Khemez, veteran, Destiny, Cheerful, Barrel-chested)

Mutaal is rather old for his occupation, but he is strong and hearty and his men respect his experience and diehard optimism. Mutaal is fearless in combat, since when he was young, a fortuneteller in his home village foretold that Mutaal would be killed by an elephant. His family sent him to live with distant relatives in the west -- well away from the usual territory of pachyderms.

**Merchant:** Bai Jaincho (Potions, poisons, and herbs, Excellent) (M, 60, Juchin, commoner, Money, Informed, Lanky)

Jaincho has travelled here from Khanashar because he has heard of the healing properties of the water and he believes he could make a fortune if he could bottle it for sale. He has cultivated contacts in Gomai and knows a good deal about the village and the monastery. He is currently trying to arrange an audience with the high priest, Tangar Kublai.

**Noble:** Tarmid Naochung (M, 82, Juchin, noble, Power, Solemn, Sick)

Tarmid is old and obviously dying. He must be carried in a palanquin and has to be helped in and out of it. He has come here in the hope of staving off mortality for a bit longer.

**Noble Guard Captain:** Kurdha Bhotsanu (M, 22, Khemez, veteran, Power, Offensive, Brown-eyed)

Kurdha is young and brash. He fought with a mercenary company in Pashan and rose to the rank of sergeant before his rudeness and temper got him drummed out of the corps. He considers himself irresistible to women (not without some justification due to his heart-melting eyes), but tends to be crude in his approaches to them. 

**Hedge Wizard:** Lo Minjung (M, 30, Juchin, mage, Power, Confused, Angular)

Minjung is scrawny and unattractive and became a wizard in the pursuit of power, particularly over the opposite sex. However, an unfortunate arcane accident left his mind clouded. He is reduced to one spell slot of each level and is unable to advance in level. He has come to Gomai in the hope that meditation and the water will clear his mind.

**Game Hunter:** Maoju (M, 35, Juchin, commoner, Destiny, Cowardly, Exhausted)

## The Falls

At the head of one of the many rills in the escarpment of the Golden Hills facing the Ghalez River valley, a waterfall issues from the mouth of a cave and plunges 120 feet down a cliff to a pool below. The spray from the pool forms a continual mist that shrouds the base of the pool.

## The Pool

The pool is famed for its reputed healing properties. During the day, 3d6 bathers congregate naked in the pool at any given time. Women are only permitted to bathe by torchlight in the hour before dawn and the hour after sunset. Men may bathe at all other times during the day, except for a half hour before or after the women's times.

The pool is screened from the path by a stand of cypress trees. Two **disciples** armed with staves stand guard at the wooden gate to control access. The monks sound a gong hung by the gate to signal changes.

A favorite trick of the monks is to allow the women's morning bathing time to extend 10 or 15 minutes past time so as to spy on them in the daylight as they dry off and dress, particularly if a fetching supplicant has come to bathe. At such times, 1d6 **disciples** will be concealed in the shrubs and rocks on the north side of the pool, having reached it by a secret path accessed by a rope-ladder dropped from the ledge on Level 9 of the monastery. This is a great weakness in the monastery's defenses.

## The Ruins

_Map: Dodecahedron 2016 - The Vansho Reliquary (page 52)_

Ruins on a hill about a quarter mile away above the cliff.

## The Monastery

_Map: Dodecahedron 2015 - Kabus' Retreat (page 20)_

On both sides of the falls, simple buildings constructed of local stone are stacked atop each other, extending from halfway up the cliff to the cave. The two topmost buildings are joined by a simple stone bridge across the mouth of the falls. A stream flows from the pool down the rill to become one of the many tributaries of the mighty Ghalez. On the south side of the stream, a path winds to the foot of the cliff, where it meets a set of stairs carved into stone that mounts up to a door on the lowest buidling on that side.

### Background

#### The Heavenly Maiden

A month ago, the junior monk Lo Juhao climbed down the secret chute in the cliff face and hid in the scrub above the pool to watch the women bathe. To his astonishment, a group of Heavenly Maidens, _tennyo_, descended from the clouds, removed their elaborate silk gowns, and began to sport in the sacred water beneath the falls. The young monk recovered from his astonishment and crept nearer to the pool to get a better look. Close to the water's edge, he came across a gown that one of the tennyo had put by. Crouching low, he cautiously stretched out an arm and picked the gown up. As Juhao basked in the delicious feel and fragrance of the silk garment, the gong that signaled the end of the women's bath time sounded. Startled, he scrambled back into his hiding-place, still clutching the tennyo's gown.

One by one, the tennyo donned their gowns and ascended back to the Celestial Realm. However, one of them, Tsa Xi-Xu, could not find her garments. She wailed piteously as her sister-maidens were forced by the arrival of dawn to leave her behind. A panicked Juhao scrambled to the chimney, only to be confronted by the high priest, Tangar Kublai, who had happened to hear a woman's cries and, fearing some scandal, came down the hidden descent to investigate. One look at the unearthly loveliness of the naked Xi-Xu was enough to convince the priest that the bundle he snatched from Juhao's shocked grasp was a fabled Gown of Flying.

The high priest's lusts were reserved, not for the flesh, but for precious things. After a moment's pause to grasp the possibilities, Tangar whipped Juhao's cloak from his shoulders, draped it around Xi-Xu's dripping form, then pulled its hood over her shining hair. Unmoved by her charms and pleas alike, the priest gave a few curt words of dismissal to his disciple, and saw the unfortunate tennyo to the gates. There he bade the guards expel her from the grounds.

The ceiling in this room is high - some 15 feet. The hallway is unlit and even during the day, the dim light from the storeroom windows does not penetrate into the gloom. A central pillar of stone, carved with friezes of celestial beings and borders scribed with holy writing, stands in the center. This pillar is the focus of the Forbiddance and Area Nondetect enchantments that cover the entire monastery.

The hallway is guarded by a **clay golem**. The golem has orders to admit no one but the high priest, Tangar Kublai, to the treasure rooms and to kill any creature that attempts to enter after being warned. Kublai wears the golem's amulet of control on a gold chain around his neck.

## The Caverns (Waterfall, Pool, Shrine Chamber, Sanctum Chamber, Pool Chamber)

_Map: Dodecahedron 2015 - Still Grotto (page 19)_ 

### Level 1

#### Waterfall

The waterfall flows from the mouth of a cave. Swallows nest in cracks on the cliff on both sides of the falls in great numbers. During the day they dart in and out of the cave mouth, especially in the early morning and early evening, feeding on mayflies and other insects. Bats roost inside the cavern as well and take over from the swallows to hunt at night.

The water is about a foot deep at the mouth of the cave, deepening to 3 feet at the midpoint of the passage that leads to the pool cavern. The water at the mouth of the cave is swift and the rock beneath the surface is smooth and slippery. A medium-size creature wading in the water within 20 feet of the mouth of the cave is considered to be in difficult terrain.

#### Pool

A little way inside, the cave becomes much larger. A pool, fed by a swift-running spring, floods the entire cave, except in a few spots where rock formations and stalagmites protrude above the surface. The pool is deepest at its center, where it is about 8 feet deep. 

On the opposite side of the cavern from the cave mouth is a natural landing formed by the rise of the cave floor. A passage opens in the wall on the north side of the landing.

The pool is also home to a variety of white carp bred by the monks. Among them is a particularly large specimen with lustrous, silver scales. This is a polymorphed **deva**, trapped in this form by an Azruun sorcerer, but saved from destruction by Tiamar Dhanbai.

The carp tend to congregate in the water off the northeast corner of the landing. The silver carp lives in the small chamber to the east, which is joined to the main pool by a narrow passage.

#### Shrine Chamber

The westernmost of the chambers contains a spectacular curtain formation. Into a niche carved into this rock, an intricately-carved jade panel has been set. The panel is seven feet in height and three in width and the central object of the carving is a (silver) dragon. The dragon's "pearl" is a sphere of untarnished silver the size of an orange that glows faintly in the total darkness of the chamber.

Before the panel is a low table of carved basalt. On the table, two censers of heavily-patinated bronze flank a tarnished silver bell with a jade handle. Lighting the joss-sticks in the censers and ringing the bell will attract the attention of _Jaolung the Benevolent_, an ancient **silver dragon** who is the patron of the _Danu_ sect that founded the monastery. If aroused, Jaolung will _scry_ into the chamber by means of a (much larger) companion of the silver sphere in the carving. He is too far away to physically affect events at the monastery, but the pair of silver balls acts as a Crystal Ball of Telepathy. The dragon will almost surely avenge any atrocities committed at the monastery, but he might also resolve to visit in disguise if he hears of the corruption that has found a foothold there.

#### Offering Chamber

On holy days, the monks leave offerings of food, incense, and burnt scrolls on a natural shelf in this chamber.

#### Deep Pool Chamber

A bronze door set into an archway guards the pool chamber. The door is worked with depictions of spirits toiling under the direction of various celestial beings. It is locked with an internal lock (DC 20) and is protected with a Glyph of Warding which holds the spell Geas. The Glyph will trigger when the door is opened (even indirectly) by any creature other than the current high priest or monk superior of the monastery. The geas targets the nearest visible creature in an attempt to compel it to guard the door to the best of its ability against intrusion by any creature, even its own allies, until relieved of this duty by the high priest or monk superior or until the spell duration expires.

The chamber is a cyst in the rock in which a pool 35 feet deep is fed from a fissure in the rock. The pool is inhabited by three lawful good **water weirds** that are bound to guard the treasure at the bottom. The treasure is contained in a watertight bronze chest hidden by a shelf such that it is not visible from the surface of the pool, even though the water is astonishingly clear. The chest is locked by an internal lock (DC 20) and trapped with a Glyph of Warding that holds the Insect Plague spell, which triggers when the chest is opened by any creature other than the high priest or monk superior.

**Treasure:** Orb of Dragonkind

#### Sanctum Chambers

A bronze door set into an archway guards the sanctum chambers. The door is worked with depictions of guardian spirits in bas-relief. It is locked with an internal lock (DC 20) and protected with a Glyph of Warding which holds the spell Spirit Guardians. The Glyph will trigger when the door is opened (even indirectly) by a creature that does not first recite the verse from the scroll on the Lesser Shrine in the Meditation Room.

There are two chambers, outer and inner, joined by a natural passageway. These are unlit, but light will reveal spectacular geological formations in both chambers.

At the far end of the inner sanctum chamber, flanked by beautiful flowstone and column speleothems, is a wooden dais, atop which sits a **mummified monk** -- none other than Tiamar Dhanbai. A lawful neutral holy sage of the old school, Tiamar is withdrawn from the world and extremely unlikely to respond to inquiry or entreaty. The monks care for his body dutifully, but in recent generations they seldom consult him. Only an existential threat to his person or the monastery itself would be sufficient to rouse him from his contemplations.

The continual prayers of this holy cleric give the water of the caverns a tincture of radiant energy, which accounts for its healing properties.

## The Resurrection of Mulao

After the adventurer's successful heist of the silver carp, Jaman Khal negotiated with Tangar Kublai and Shang Shinlao for its return in exchange for bringing Jian Mulao back to life by means of the _resurrection_ spell. As Kublai cannot do the resurrection himself, he must supplicate Tiamar Dhanbai, which will take some time. Knowing the potential for things to go awry, Jaman sends the adventurers to escort Mulao's body to the monastery and bring her back once she has recovered from the effects of being resurrected.

Along with the adventurers, Jaman has sent a guard of 5 **mounted soldiers** led by a **veteran**, Urdan Temay. All are armed with composite bows, lances, scimitars, and daggers. These are Juchin nomad warriors from the tribe of Baichu Ketlan, a _hetman_ who has ties to Jaman. The warriors escort an ornate ox-drawn funeral cart containing Mulao's body, which has been protected from decay by means of a Gentle Repose spell. Unused to the comforts of civilization, the nomads will insist on camping outside the town.

Alerted by her spies, Xenadria has sent a team of 4 **jackalweres** led by a female **jackalwere assassin** to Gomai to find out what Jaman is up to and disrupt it if she may. With them is Jian Jinseo, Mulao's sister, who Xenadria recruited after her conversion to the worship of Shrivra. Under the lamia's influence, Jinseo blames Jaman, Mulao, the elders of Machu Quon, and the adventurers equally for her family's shame. The six are traveling disguised as a Ahlraini spice merchant from Basrul named Alad Bazi, his wives Shara and Nahia, and their retainers. Their cover story is that Alad's wives are barren and they have come to the falls in the hope of a cure. The women wear veils, but a character who stands within 5 feet of Jinseo might notice that her eyes are Juchin.

Unless they are stopped, Xenadria's spies will find out about the adventurer's mission. Xenadria will then attempt to substitute a simulacrum for Mulao and use the real Mulao as bait for a trap. 

Also, the paladin Shang Shinlao knows about the adventurers and their mission. Shamed by his failure to stop the theft of the silver carp, he plots revenge against the adventurers. He has given his word that he will honor the arrangements for the swap, but in oblique ways he has set trouble in motion for the party. First, through Lo Juhao, he sent word to Tsa Xi-Xu, the tennyo to which the temple's Gown of Flying really belongs, that the adventurers know where her gown is hidden. Next, he planted a rumor with Kurdu Kolang that the _Libram of Kunain_ can be found in the ruins above the monastery. Finally, knowing of the rivalries between the nomad tribes, he has arranged to get word to a group of nomad bandits that their hereditary enemies will be escorting a rich treasure. Shang plans to be on hand should any of his attempts to split the party and get them in over their heads bear fruit.
