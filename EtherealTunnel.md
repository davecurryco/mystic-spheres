You conjure a an immobile tunnel through the Ethereal Plane that links an unoccupied space you can see within range to a destination on the same plane of existence. The tunnel is a cylindrical space, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter and up to 60 feet long. You can orient the tunnel in any direction you choose. The tunnel can extend through gasses, fluids, or even solid objects, but does not affect their integrity. The tunnel lasts for the duration.

The tunnel can be entered only through the ends of the cylindrical space. Spells such as dimension door and gate do not work if either the origin or destination is inside the tunnel. Travel within the tunnel is possible using normal movement or ethereal travel. Magical and physical effects originating from outside the tunnel can't affect creatures inside it.
