# Calendars

## Planetary Cycles

The campaign planet completes a rotation around its sun every 360 days. The planet's single moon completes a rotation each 30 days. The planet's axis is tilted relative to its plane of revolution around the sun, producing distinct seasons. The planet rotates around its axis at a rate comparable with that of Earth.

## Elven Calendars

### Illuvarin

The Illuvarin of the mortal world use a calendar that observes four months of 90 days each according to the four seasons. They count each cycle of the moon as a week. For arcane and scientific use, they divide the day into halves, quarters, sixteenths, thirty-seconds, sixty-fourths, one-twenty-eighths, and two-fifty-sixths and refer to the time using the nearest division necessary for their meaning. In social use, they usually refer only to daytime and nighttime.

Illuvarin dwelling in Aelvalon are generally indifferent to time, observing only the divisions (day and night, the seasons) that are relevant to the realm in which they dwell.

### Dharovin

In the timeless darkness of Underearth, the Dharovin's only reference for time is an arbitrary one established by their theocracy. The priestesses demand sacrifices and obesiance according to the unfathomably complex workings of crystal timepieces kept by each temple. The Dark Elves refer to events with reference to the rule of a given High Priestess. Since it is commonplace for rival temples and priestesses to vie with one another, Dharovin culture lacks a common reference for timekeeping. This is a significant factor in the disunity characteristic of Dharovin society.

The Dharovin of Arestor observe the same time divisions used by the Illuvarin, but with different names for the months.

The Daimoijin also use the Illuvarin divisions, again with different month-names.

## Dwarven Calendar

Dwarves of both Kindreds use a calendar of twelve months of 30 days each, according to the cycles of the moon. They do not subdivide the month into weeks. They divide the day into ten hours and divide each hour into one-hundredths. To keep track of time underground, dwarves use mechanical and crystal-based clocks of various degrees of sophistication and accuracy.

## Human Calendars

### Telenar

The Telenar calendar has twelve months of 30 days each. The month is divided into two fortnights of 15 days each. The day is divided into sixteen hours. The new year begins on the day of the summer solstice (midsummer).

### Southern Kingdoms

The calendar used in the Southern Kingdoms has twenty-four months of 15 days each (new moon and old moon). The day is divided into twenty-four hours. The new year begins on the first new moon after the spring equinox.

## Halfling Calendar

Halflings are unique in using a calendar of six months of 60 days each. The first each month is a major holiday, for which the month is named. The months are divided into four fortnights of 15 days each. The days are divided into twenty-four hours, twelve of day and twelve of night. The new year begins on the first day after the winter solstice (midwinter).

Halfling scribes record dates in long form ("the fifth day of the third fortnight of Burgeontide in the year 2917") or in short form ("Bur. 3/5, 2917). The short form may omit the day ("Bur. 3, 2917").

## Goblin Calendar

The goblin races all use a calendar of twelve months of 30 days according to the lunar cycle. Only hobgoblins subdivide the day and night into twenty-four hours. Other goblins simply observe midnight, noon, dawn and moonrise.
