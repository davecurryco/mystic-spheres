# The Garden of the Nightingale

Outside the Sunset Wall of the city of Nashal, a high stone wall set with sturdy gates and peaked towers encloses a cemetery used by the rulers and noble houses for centuries. Elaborate mausoleums and tomb monuments of rose-colored sandstone stand amid beautifully-maintained lawns, hedges and gardens. The necropolis is called the Garden of the Nightingale by the people of Nashal, and indeed the lamenting song of those birds can often be heard at nightfall amid the cypress and olive trees that shade the tombs by day. By all appearances, the cemetery is a place of peace and rest. But, within the white walls of the tombs, corruption creeps.

Members of an underground cult of Kushyth are using the mausoleums as secret meeting places for their dark rituals. They have raised a few Spawn of Kyuss, which they plan to unleash on the Shambles as soon as they have enough of them. The cultists know that the Smugglers' Syndicate keeps warehouses in the cemetery, but both are unaware that it is also the haunt of a baital -- a vampiress. The adventurers, bearing the Relic of Arkraz Khalharzra on an unrelated mission, could well upset the balance between these factions -- knowingly or unknowingly.

## The Grounds

_Map: Maps for Your Adventures Set 3 (page 10)_

The Garden of the Nightingale is surrounded by a 15-foot high, 5-foot thick wall of smooth, closely-set sandstone blocks (DC 15 to climb) filled with rubble. Square towers 25 feet tall are set at 40-foot intervals along the north, south, and west walls. On the east side, the wall borders the ditch that runs along the city walls. The towers on this side are round and their spires reach 35 feet in height. Gates of wrought iron secure the entrances at gatehouses set between square towers in a number of places, mostly along the west wall.

The grounds of the Garden are divided into a number of sections, bounded by a network of paths laid down in sandstone flags and bordered in many places by low walls of the same stone. Pools and fountains are supplied by an underground extension of one of the city's aquaducts.

At any given time, the Garden is protected by a force of 10 **elite guards** led by a **guard commander**. During the day, two guards stand watch at each of the gates and two patrol the grounds. Their commander makes rounds to ensure that each group is engaged in its duty. At night, the gates are locked and no one is admitted so the guards patrol the grounds in groups of five, one of which is accompanied by the commander.

The guard commander is in the pay of the Smuggler's Syndicate and distributes bribes to his men to ignore certain off-hours visitors and strange activity. Unknowingly, this benefits the Kushyth cultists on the rare occasions when their activities are noticed.

Daytime visitors must satisfy the guards that they have a legitimate reason to be there. Strangers, of course, must stand greater scrutiny than citizens, especially wealthy citizens. Since no visitors are allowed at night, the guards will move to apprehend any intruders they see -- unless they have instructions otherwise.

## Places

### 1. The North Tower

This tower is broader than the towers that support the wall. It has guardrooms on the first and second floors, but these are seldom used.

A **spy** hides on the top floor of the tower, waiting for a signal from a band of smugglers operating from the Hill of Sorrows that a shipment of _khavyss_, a fine brandy, is on its way and will need to be let in by the North Gate. He will avoid contact with any intruders, but he will warn his counterparts by means of a lantern signal if he spots any unusual activity.

### 2. House Qaiqati Mausoleum

This mausoleum was selected by the smugglers as a clandestine warehouse because it is large and close to the North Gate. The current heir of the house, Ni'hy Rooqib bal-Qaiqati, has a weakness for gambling that left him open for extortion by the smugglers.

### 3. The Northeast Tower

### 4. Tomb of Am'na baz Laamee bal-Sa

This rose-colored sandstone tomb is unusual for its design -- an octagonal structure with pillars at each corner atop a stepped base and surmounted by a pointed dome. Lancet arches pierced by latticework designs adorn each face of the octagon. On the north face, a roofed portico supported by four columns protects the door, an ornately-decorated affair of iron sheathed in bronze plates.

Am'na herself was a witch who consorted with many lovers, human and demon alike, sometime in the very presence of her husband, the Chief Magistrate Rashyaa Jalee bal-Sa, who she had bewitched. Unexpectedly released from this enchantment through a chance blessing from a wandering holy man, Rashyaa exacted revenge on the monster he had married. To prevent shame to his house, he covered up the killing and constructed this elaborate tomb as an outward sign of extreme grief. However, Am'na's debts to the powers of darkness remained outstanding and her damned soul was returned to her body to haunt the cemetery as a **baital**.

Am'na takes shelter in her tomb during the day and emerges at night to inflict suffering on the people of the city. She takes form as a woman veiled and cloaked in black and steals through the western gates to inflict suffering on lunatics and other unfortunates abroad in the South Gate Ward after dark. Sometimes, she inhabits the corpses newly interred in the cemetery, but she does so cunningly, so as to avoid suspicion that might lead to discovery. 

### 5. House Saiqali Mausoleum

This unpreposessing mausoleum of a minor noble house is the meeting-place for members of the cult of Kushyth. A secret tunnel connects it to a warehouse outside the wall of the cemetery and to the mausoleum to the south, which houses the Spawn of Kyuss.

A **cultist** watches from the shadows of the door to this mausoleum. He will not interfere with the adventurers unless they seem to be on the verge of discovering the cult's presence here. 

### 6. House Majmii Mausoleum

### 7. House Ghyaa Mausoleum

The adventurers have been instructed to conceal the Relic of Arkraz Khalharzra inside one of the crypts in this mausoleum.

As they go about their mission, the adventurers will notice a woman, cloaked and veiled in black, step out of the shadows of the gate to the south of this mausoleum and walk up the path toward the northeast. This is the **baital** Am'na returning from one of her forays into the city.

### 8. House Dahai Mausoleum

This is one of the largest and most impressive mausoleums in the cemetery, as befits the leading position of House Dahai.

### 9. House Madhai Mausoleum

### 10. House Habai Mausoleum

### 11. House Tahai Mausoleum

### 12. House Adr Mausoleum

### 13. Tomb of Qat'yah az Taa'sa bal-Mee

Qat'yah was the scion of a noble house and a poet of considerable accomplishment and renoun. On his death, his body was laid in a sepulchure of white marble with decorative borders inscribed with some of his verse. The sepulchure is enclosed by a pavillion, which consists of a raised base of sandstone on which eight pillars, each 30 feet high, support a stepped, eight-sided dome of copper. The ceiling of the dome is decorated with a mosaic of tiles. Crystals enchanted with permanent light spells are set in niches at the top of the columns, where they light the ceiling from beneath.

### 14. The Southeast Tower

Built to the same dimensions as the North Tower, this tower also houses guardrooms. However, this tower's chambers are in daily use by the guards. At night, there will be five **guards** here and, perhaps, the **guard commander**, if he is not out with the grounds patrol.
