**Bound.** The silver bard is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the silver bard and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet's wearer can telepathically call the silver bard to travel to it, and the silver bard knows the distance and direction to the amulet. While the silver bard is within 10 feet of the wearer, the wearer shares the silver bard's Magic Resistance trait. If the silver bard is within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded up) is transferred to the silver bard.

**Immutable Form.** The silver bard is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Regeneration.** The silver bard regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

**Magic Resistance.** The silver bard has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The silver bard makes two scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Enchanting Song.** The silver bard sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the silver bard that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The wearer of the silver bard's amulet automatically succeeds on this saving throw. The silver bard must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the silver bard is incapacitated.

While charmed by the silver bard, a target is incapacitated and ignores everything but the silver bard's song. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the silver bard, the target can take the Dash action on its turn to move toward the silver bard by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the silver bard, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this silver bard's song for the next 24 hours. However, a female humanoid that has been charmed by the silver bard's song will continue to regard the bard favorably unless the bard's actions are unmistakably hostile.

**Limited Teleport. (3/day)** The silver bard can use an action to instantly teleport to an unoccupied space within 5' of its amulet. 

## Reactions

**Shield.** When a creature makes an attack against the wearer of the silver bard's amulet, the silver bard grants a +5 bonus to the wearer's AC if the silver bard is within 5 feet of the wearer.

**Silver Bards** are constructs similar to shield guardians, but they are made of silver metal in the size and form of a handsome man and have eyes of precious stone. Silver Bards are designed as companions as well as guardians. They are particularly well suited as protectors for cloistered women. A silver bard might be found as the incorruptable chaperon of an emperor's seraglio or as the companion bodyguard of a high priestess. These constructs are so perfectly-mannered and engaging that it is not unknown for their charges to fall in love with them -- a love that is doomed to be unrequited.

In rare cases, some silver bards have transferred their devotion from their amulet to the wearer herself. In one legendary instance, an ambitious vizer stole the amulet of a silver bard that was the long-time companion bodyguard of a virtuous queen. In an attempted coup, the vizer ordered the construct to kill their mistress, only to be beheaded himself by a stroke of the silver bard's scimitar. Some arcane scholars speculate that the intelligence and charisma of the spirit that animates a silver bard make it possible that one could develop true sentience -- or even emotion.
