# Campaign Background

## Origins

The campaign is set on an earth-like planet orbiting a yellow dwarf star somewhat older than Sol. There are four other planets in the solar system, three of which are visible to the naked eye from the campaign planet. The main planet has a single moon, somewhat smaller and further away than Earth's moon.

This planet was mature, but devoid of intelligent life until some twenty thousand years before the time of the campaign. A planar-travelling proto-elven race, the Aelvii, discovered the campaign solar system. Facing imminent defeat in a millenia-long conflict with the aberrant Xuthuulli, the Aelvii traveled to the campaign planet, which they called _Queaya_ (Land of Hope), to find refuge.

The rest of the Aelvii, who remained behind to fight in the rear-guard action against the Xuthuulli, were overwhelmed and never followed. Before they were wiped out, they covered up the existence of Queaya to keep the aberrants from finding the refugees.

In exile, Aelvii civilization became insular and decadent. Their mages created other humanoid races (dwarves, humans, goblins, and orcs) as servants and soldiers. Eventually, Aelvii politics degenerated into fratricidal conflict. Aelvii civilization was smashed, their cities ruined, and even the continents were altered. The survivors, still bitterly divided, withdrew into small communities in the forests and on isolated coasts. Their arcane traditions were fragmented. The servant races rebelled and broke away to pursue their own destinies. To the extent that they had the capacity and had been given or had stolen the secrets, these new races were able to use magic to varying degrees.
