**Devil’s Luck (3/day).** If the cambion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Fiendish Blessing.** The AC of the cambion includes its Charisma bonus.

**Glyph of Recall.** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its fiendish parent’s home plane, the cambion is transported to that plane.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The cambion’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The cambion can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

Cantrips: _eldritch blast, minor illusion, true strike_  
3/day each: _command, dispel magic, invisibility, shield_  
1/day each: _plane shift_  

In addition, Glazdrina knows the following Eldritch Invocations, with which she is imbued at all times:

_beguiling influence, devil's sight_

**Blasphemous Word.** As a bonus action, the cambion utters a blasphemous word. Each non-fiendish creature within 10 feet of the cambion that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the cambion’s next turn. Good-aligned creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cambion makes two melee attacks or uses Fire Spear twice.

**Hell’s Fury Strike.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, plus 10 (3d6) fire damage.

**Fire Spear**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, 120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) fire damage.

**Fiendish Charm.** One humanoid the cambion can see within 30 feet of it must save on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the cambion’s spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from the cambion or its allies or receives a suicidal command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion’s Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.

**Fiendish Substitution (1/day).** The cambion switches places with a fiend from its infernal parent’s home plane until the end of its next turn. The fiend may be of any type with a challenge rating less than that of the cambion’s infernal parent. The fiend acts as an ally of the cambion on the cambion’s initative count.

**Glazdrina** is a favored **cambion** daughter of the devil prince Azariel. At sixteen years old, she is as voluptuous and lascivious as the most jaded of mortal sluts, and is as capricious and cruel as the fiends of the blackest pits of Hell.
