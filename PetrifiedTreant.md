## Actions

**Multiattack.** The petrified treant makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a single target, the petrified treant can use Life Drain against that target as a free action (the Life Drain attack automatically hits).

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Life Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Animate Trees (1/Day).** The petrified treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the petrified treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the petrified treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the petrified treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.

**Petrified Treants** are treants that, through long exposure to a confluence of necrotic, fey and elemental earth energies, have turned to stone from the heartwood out. A petrified treant's guardianship of its territory is a dark obsession with it and it takes grim delight in inflicting psychic and physical pain on any creature it deems an intruder.
