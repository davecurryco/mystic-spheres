## Actions

**Multiattack.** The chain makes two attacks, only one of which may be _constrict_.

**Lash.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage (padlocks) or piercing damage (spikes).

**Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the chain can't constrict another target. In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

A **Chain of Binding** is similar to other animated objects. It appears to be a normal metal chain, set with either spikes or padlocks, but it will animate and attack under conditions set by its master.
