# Pirates of the Kheraz Coast

## Introduction

Several crews of _Euijin_ pirates from Ilshan used galleys captured from the Red Reavers to reach coastal Ophar, where they have set up bases from which to raid shipping along the Sea of Kheraz.

## Factions

### Red Reavers

The dark sorceror Rashazer raised a fleet of galleys to conduct slave-raids, disrupt trade, and destabilize the kingdoms of the southeastern coast. The galleys are called the Red Reavers for their crimson sails. Their base of operations is Bar-Brukgrosh, a hobgoblin harbor city in Beranur that is part of the domain Barazan granted to Rashazer. The nearby forest of Er-Gradghul supplies timber for construction of the ships. The oarsmen and other crew are drawn from the local Urgrak hobgoblin tribes, whose members are distinct because of their tattooed skin and shaved heads.

Although the early galleys were manned entirely by hobgoblins, Rashazer has experimented with other crew and vessel types. He recruited seafaring oni from islands north of Illshan to serve as galley captains. For special missions, he supplemented some crews with summoned devils.

### Euijin

The _Daimojin_ tyranny of Illshan does not hold absolute sway. _Danyo_ Shoda Hideosu's prohibition on intercoastal shipping and his order that the crew of any foreign vessel shipwrecked on Illshan be instantly put to death have both had unanticipated consequences. The first fiat created a scarcity of luxury items, which created the incentive for _Aili_ fishermen and seagoing traders to become smugglers and for many _Daimojin_ families to tacitly accept this. The second order gave cover to certain coastal _Daimojin_ lords who made pacts with the smugglers to share in the cargo of any ships the latter could lure onto the reefs. As their strategies became more aggressive, some of these smugglers became, in essence, privateers. A few of these lost their scruples about taking only foreign ships and crossed the line into outright piracy. Praus crewed by _Aili_ freebooters, sometimes commanded by _Daimojin_ renegades, began to prey on shipping between the islands of Illshan. The pirates became known as _Euijin_, which means "outlaw-folk".

The limited volume and value of inter-island shipping might have doomed the _Euijin_ to meager prospects had not the pirates lured several Red Reavers into ambushes off the coasts of Kalii and Honu and seized their galleys as prizes. The _Aili_ still had the skill of intercoastal navigation and with larger, more seaworthy ships, the _Euijin_ widened their horizons across the Sea of Kheraz.

### Pashani Privateers

In their perennial wars, the various city-states of Pashan have frequently issued letters of marque and reprisal. Often, privateers neglect to cease operations once a peace treaty is concluded and technically become pirates. Particularly aggressive or greedy Pashani privateers seek prey far afield of the Sea of Hazrad.

### Khanashari Smugglers

Governed as they are by a far-away bureaucracy with a tendency toward oppressive taxation, the coastal provinces of Khahashar west of the Golden Hills have a long tradition of smuggling. These smugglers often turn pirate, preying on merchant ships, towns, and even each other.

## Ships

### Pirates

#### The Black Dawn (_Danasha Myo_)

**Captain:** Koju Kishina (Gladiator, Daimojin) (Self-improvement/Informed/Tall)  
_Captain Kishina is a strikingly tall and handsome warrior whose quest for mastery of swordsmanship and seamanship led him to his current occupation. He has a network of spies that keep him informed of the movement and strength of ships in the area. Due to his upbringing, he is indifferent to life (his own as well as that of others). He kills only when he has reason to, but his reasons can be arbitrary, to say the least._

**First Mate:** Makala-Koho (Pirate Veteran, Aili) (Amusement/Condescending/Olive)  
_Maka is dark-skinned even for an Aili. He is intelligent and easily bored, which led him to a life of adventure on the seas. He slakes his thirst for excitement with mayhem in combat and acts of torture and rape afterward. Only Captain Kishina's restraining hand keeps Maka from slaughtering everyone aboard a captured vessel. On shore leave, Maka is the type to pick a fight that results in the burning of a tavern, or an entire village. The hands aboard the ship regard Maka with a mixture of awe and fear._

**Ship's Mage:** Tairu Ohsune (Mage, Daimojin) (Power/Fanciful/Elegant)  
_Master Tairu's Dharovin ancestry is apparent in his fine features and lust for domination over others. His elegant silk robes display his refined tastes and his privileged position at once. He thinks of himself as a lord of Aelvalon in exile and dreams that he will one day regain his rightful place. Tairu distains the crew, who he regards as little better than the serfs he bullied at home. He thinks that Captain Kishina is too familiar with them and therefore, too lenient. Needless to say, the crew, especially the Aili, despise Tairu._

**Navigator:** Jenlang Kwo (Pirate Veteran, Juchin) (Recognition/Bitter/Brown-eyed) 
_Jenlang's took ship with Kishina in the hope of an opportunity to become known as an explorer, a charter of the uncharted. He has a deep resentment of the money-grubbing merchants who were his previous employers. If it were up to him, no merchantman would come off an encounter with The Black Dawn without being burned down to the waterline. His light brown eyes are unusual for a Juchin. The suggestion that he is of mixed ancestry makes Jenlan feel even more an outcast. He is easily slighted, but as he is a man of no great courage, he wreaks revenge in backdoor ways._  

**Chief Helmsman:** Kohuunau-Olo (Pirate Veteran, Aili) (Honor/Offensive/Spirited)
_Kohu is a giant of a man, fiercely decorated with tribal tattoos. He is the son of a shaman and is prone to be visited by the spirits himself in the late watches of the night. He gives and takes offense easily, particularly in matters of the mmyriad superstitions he holds. Most of the crew give him a wide berth._

**Purser:** Lao Jian (Rogue 3, Juchin) (Money/Bitter/Grotesque)  
_Lao was the apprentice of an alchemist, but a lab explosion left his face and upper chest horribly disfigured. He harbors a hatred for women, who have scorned him since his accident. He took to forgery and embezzlement to buy their affections. When his thefts were discovered, he took his life of crime to the seas. Despite his crooked past, Lao is fair in the appraisal of prizes and the partition of spoils. But it pleases him far more to see female prisoners violated and sold into slavery than to see them ransomed unharmed._ 

**Bosun:** Honokame-Kiila (Pirate Thug, Aili) (Curiosity/Cheerful/Gaunt)  
_Hono is easygoing and optimistic. He is wiry and athletic and is the first to climb the mast to stand lookout. He wants to see as much as the world as he can. Signing aboard a pirate vessel gave him that chance, but he would be just as happy to go legit if the opportunity came. He often uses his influence to redirect his fellows' wantonness along less destructive paths._

**Bosun:** Jeraz Mauhaut (Pirate Knight, Khemez) (Romance/Reflective/Lanky)  
_Jeraz is the youngest son of a noble family. He is highly literate and even writes poetry. Having squandered his fortune on dissolute living, he took to the sea, despite his lanky frame. When the ship he signed on to was taken by pirates, he readily took the oath, as it suited his notions of turning his back on his past. He will be the first to admit that it hasn't turned out like he imagined, but he does love the swordplay. Few of the pirates would care to meet him across three feet of steel._

**Bosun:** Kokula-Kaunua (Pirate Thug, Aili) (Power/Confused/Ungainly)  
_Koku is stupid and rather clumsy. He is a bully who drifted into piracy and has no idea where he is going in life or why. Nevertheless, he is probably the strongest man aboard except, perhaps, for Anra. His leadership style mainly consists of bashing heads together, which works well enough in a crisis. His men make things livable by taking advantage of his denseness to work around him the rest of the time._

**Marine Sergent:** Anra Okeeshala (Berserker 4, Kwanshali) (Glory/Brave/Wild)  
_Anra is a formidable warrior who lives for the thrill of battle and the exultation of victory. He seeks to make a name for himself that will spread all along the southeast coast. Although he is at all times an imposing presence, Anra takes special pains to make himself look savage and fearsome before going into combat, adopting the white war-paint of the coastal cannibals even though his own tribe is far inland. He is probably the best leader of men aboard the ship, the captain included, and Maka keeps a sharp eye on him._

**Marine Sergent:** Belaz kal-Sheer (Veteran, Khemez) (Survival/Reverant/Chiseled)  
_Belaz is a devout worshipper of Molor, the God of Strife. He believes that all life is a struggle for survival and that the strong deserve to crush the weak. In fact, he sees this as a sacred obligation. Weakness of any sort has no place in his philosophy and he devotes his spare time to exercise and training at arms. He may not be as strong as Anra, but his physique is more toned._

**Carpenter:** Jhiraz Qian (Pirate, Juchin) (Fear/Sarcastic/Frail)  
_Jhiraz was a passenger aboard a vessel that was captured by pirates. The pirates eagerly pressed him into service and the thoroughly cowed Jhiraz readily took the oath. He is terrified by the sea and is constantly busy to make the ship as seaworthy and combat-ready as possible as a mather of self-preservation. As a result of the stress and overwork, he is in poor health and ill spirits. He coughs constantly between caustic comments about anything and everything._

**Chief Gunner:** Kaheera Zhulha (Fighter 4, Kwanshali) (Revenge/Sincere/Pimply)  
_Kaheera thirsts for revenge against the slavers who destroyed his village and took him captive in his youth. His face is deeply pockmarked from a disease he contracted aboard the slave vessel and his back is scarred from the lash. He is blunt and callous, but he always says what he means and does what he says. Kaheera considers Anra and others of his tribe to be uncouth rustics and doesn't get along terribly well with them._

**Galley (Bireme)**

**Cargo:** 2 tons and 22 marines (casualties: 12 marines dead, Tairu dead, Anna-9, Koku-24, Belaz -17, 4-10, 8-10, 14-5)  
**Crew:** 62 crew (rabble) / 12 officers  

**Weapons:** 3 ballista (shot,chain) port & starboard / 1 ballista fore & aft / 0 amidships  

### Merchants

#### The Joy Rose (_Kelaz Nashar_)

**Captain:** Almed Narazren (Sea Captain, Khemez) (Honor, Critical, Average)  
_Captain Narazren is a nondescript sort who you would never notice in the marketplace. Yet, on the bridge, he assumes an undeniable air of command. It is a point of honor with him that he has never lost a ship under his command. He expects everything aboard to be in topnotch order, and woe to the hapless sailor who fails to attend to some particular under the captain's gaze._

**First Mate:** Mahourad Kelzeer (Sailor Veteran, Khemez) (Greed, Cheerful, Spirited)  
_Mahourad is a capable and experienced sailor, and might be a ship's captain, but for his love of strong drink. He is seldom incapaciated, but he is seldom entirely sober either. Fortunately for the crew, drink makes him jolly, rather than mean. He often breaks into snatches of bawdy song and is fond of practical jokes._

**Navigator:** Naram bal-Oham (Sailor, Khemez) (Loyalty, Confused, Filthy)  
_Naram has shipped with Captain Narazren on several voyages and is unswervingly loyal to him. Unfortunately, he is prone to mistakes in navigation that render him thoroughly lost. However, each major incident of this type has been covered up by some amazing stroke of fortune or misfortune. In propitiation of the gods, Naram has vowed not to bathe or cut his hair or beard for the entire voyage._

**Chief Helmsman:** Ramal Mareed (Sailor, Khemez) (Amusement, Cheerful, Olive)  
_Ramal has a lighter complexion than most Khemez, due to Juchin ancestry on his mother's side. He is an inveterate gambler and invariably loses his earnings from each voyage in a few days in port. Nevertheless, he is optimistic that his luck will turn for the good next time._

**Purser:** Cheung Lun (Spy, Juchin) (Boredom, Bitter, Scarred)  
_Master Lun grew up in a merchant family and learned his trade there. Bored with mere accounting and bitter at having been passed over for advancement, he was readily recruited into a spy ring that feeds information to pirates. His face and body are covered in scars, which he attributes to having been washed up on a reef after a shipwreck, but is actually due to his having been keelhauled after having been discovered._

**Bosun:** Baalamed Alhoor (Sailor Veteran, Khemez) (Loyalty, Fanciful, Buff)  
_Baal is another of Captain Narazren's trusted insiders. He is a muscular man, having been an oarsman on a galley in his youth. He is, however, prone to over-imagination and superstition._

**Supercargo:** Guang Fenghir (Greed, Malicious, Pimply)  
_Master Fenghir is the Shylock of the Sea. His avariciousness and villainous nature are as plain to see as the pimples in his oily complexion._

**Sailing Ship (Junk)**

**Cargo:** 24 tons (35 max)  
**Crew:** 30 crew / 7 officers (casualties: 2 sailors dead, Almed-8, Ramal dead, 2-2, 5-7, 10-8, 12-8, 15-8, 17-2)

**Weapons:** 5 stingers port & starboard / 1 ballista (shot, chain) aft / 1 ballista (shot, chain) amidships  

#### The Blessed Venture (_Almed Asher_)

**Captain:** Harzed Alhamra

**Sailing Ship (Dhow)**

**Cargo:** 60 tons (100 max)  
**Crew:** 30 crew (able sailors)

## Encounters

### The Black Dawn vs. The Joy Rose

**Weather:** Fair Weather (Strong winds, no rain, light seas)  
**Winds:** h1 - Due North, 32 knots (+4)  
**Sighting:** 8th hour of 3rd watch (dawn) the Black Dawn (heading h10) sights the Rose of Joy (heading h9) bearing dead ahead (h1) at 3 miles, 14 miles due South of the coast, 100 miles West Southwest of Moshul Bay. The Rose has not yet sighted the Dawn.  
**Heading/Speed:** Black Dawn heading h10, speed 2 knots, under short sail. Rose of Joy heading h9, speed 6 knots, under main sail.

#### Current State (37 rounds after combat began)

**Weather:** Fair Weather (Strong winds, no rain, light seas)  
**Winds:** h5 - Southeast, 32 knots (+4)  
**Heading/Speed:** Black Dawn heading h11, speed 5 knots, under plain sail (50% speed due to battle damage, 8 crew manning pump to fight leak in aft hull compartment -- crew quarters). Rose of Joy heading h11, speed 6 knots, under main sail and oars (full speed to to repairs to rigging). The Dawn follows the Rose just out of range of her stingers and hazards a shot with the bow ballista as often as it can be reloaded.

The crew of the Black Dawn are enraged at the effective resistance the Joy Rose has made to this point. Captain Narazren can guess as much and he assumes that no quarter will be given. His plan is to stay ahead of the Dawn for another 15 nautical miles so as to come to a section of the coast where he can turn into a harbor that is sheltered by a reef (Seamanship DC 15 to avoid running aground, Narazren has advantage since he is familiar with these waters).

On round 40, the dead crewmen of the Rose will rise as zombies due to the influence of Mother Saloma's relic. The zombies will emerge from the main hold and attack the living crewmen, causing consternation and panic aboard the junk.
