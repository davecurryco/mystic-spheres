## Spell Effects

### Naval Combat

While most magic that would be useful in normal combat is equally useful in naval combat, some spells are particularly useful, or have additional effects associated with them.

**Animate Object:** A rope or line counts as a Tiny object and an oar counts as a Small object for purposes of this spell. Animated ropes can be ordered to tie and untie themselves, affecting a single mast of a ship's rigging. Animated oars can row a vessel or can obstruct rowers, negating their contribution to the vessel's movement.  
**Burning Hands:** This spell causes any flammable object within the area of effect, which includes a ship’s hull and rigging, to catch fire. Burning portions of a ship take 1d6 damage per round until put out by a character (which takes one full round). Each round, there is a cumulative 5% chance that the fire will spread to an adjacent section of hull (burning rigging spreads randomly to one of the ship’s hull sections). This spreading can continue indefinitely, eventually engulfing the entire ship if not contained.  
**Chain Lightning:** A ship's masts count as separate objects for the purposes of this spell.  
**Cone of Cold:** This spell causes objects within its area of effect to become very brittle, becoming vulnerable to bludgeoning and force damage for 1d4 rounds.  
**Conjure Elemental:** An air elemental can direct wind against the sails of one of a ship's masts, positively or negatively affecting the vessel's speed under sail by 5 ft. per round.  A water elemental can aid or impede a waterborne vehicle's speed by 5 ft. per round.  
**Control Water:** This spell can increase or decrease the wave intensity within its area of effect by up to one category/4 levels.  
**Control Weather:** You can use this spell to shift the wind to a direction favorable to you and unfavorable to your enemy, or to becalm an enemy ship and leave it stranded.  
**Delayed Blast Fireball:** This spell causes any flammable object within the area of effect, which includes a ship’s hull and rigging, to catch fire. Burning portions of a ship take 1d6 damage per round until put out by a character (which takes one full round). Each round, there is a cumulative 5% chance that the fire will spread to an adjacent section of hull (burning rigging spreads randomly to one of the ship’s hull sections). This spreading can continue indefinitely, eventually engulfing the entire ship if not contained.  
**Disintegrate:** You can target a 10-foot section of a ship’s hull or a single mast of the ship’s rigging with this spell.   
**Earthquake:** A casting of this spell has a 2% chance of creating a tsunami. Casting this spell multiple times in succession (once per round) increases this chance by 2% each time, but you only get to roll once.  
**Enlarge/Reduce:** If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell affects only a lO-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.  
**Fabricate:** This spell can repair damaged sections of a ship, provided the appropriate amount of raw material (wood, rope and/or canvas) is available.  
**Fireball, fire bolt, fire storm, flaming sphere:** These spells cause any flammable object within the area of effect, which includes a ship’s hull and rigging, to catch fire. Burning portions of a ship take 1d6 damage per round until put out by a character (which takes one full round). Each round, there is a cumulative 5% chance that the fire will spread to an adjacent section of hull (burning rigging spreads randomly to one of the ship’s hull sections). This spreading can continue indefinitely, eventually engulfing the entire ship if not contained.  
**Flame Blade, flame strike:** These spells _do not_ cause flammable objects within the area of effect to catch fire.  
**Forcecage:** The cage of force created by this spell is immobile, even if cast on a ship. Particularly nasty mages cast this spell on enemies on the deck of a ship, forcing them to watch helplessly as their ship literally sails out from under them.  
**Grease:** When cast on the deck of a ship where an enemy force is boarding, the boarders suffer a –2 penalty to their saves (since leaping onto the deck of another ship requires great force and speed). Canny spellcasters can also position the effect of this spell so that creatures slipping on the grease risk falling overboard.  
**Gust of Wind:** Though the effect of this spell is not large enough to have a major impact on a ship, it can still damage the rigging if aimed properly (1d4 points of damage).  
**Hallucinatory Terrain:** Some unscrupulous pirates use this spell to make a section of reef look like open ocean. When ships run aground on the hidden obstruction, the pirates sail in, kill the crew, and take the cargo.  
**Incendiary Cloud:** This spell _does not_ cause flammable objects within the area of effect to catch fire.  
**Leomund's Tiny Hut:** Unlike _force cage_, the dome of force created by this spell moves along with a vehicle which the caster is aboard at the time of casting.   
**Levitate:** This spell affects an entire ship so only vessels up to 500 lbs. can be affected.  
**Magic Weapon:** This spell can be cast on ship-mounted weapons and siege engines, such as ballistae and catapults.  
**Mending:** This spell restores 1d8 hit points to any section of a ship or its rigging it is cast on.  
**Message:** This spell is useful for coordination and communication with multiple ships.  
**Meteor Swarm:** This spell causes any flammable object within the area of effect, which includes a ship’s hull and rigging, to catch fire. Burning portions of a ship take 1d6 damage per round until put out by a character (which takes one full round). Each round, there is a cumulative 5% chance that the fire will spread to an adjacent section of hull (burning rigging spreads randomly to one of the ship’s hull sections). This spreading can continue indefinitely, eventually engulfing the entire ship if not contained.  
**Mirage Arcane:** Pirate mages use this spell to disguise islands or reefs as open sea. Since this spell can hide structures, as well, pirates often build their base on the island, the better to get to the loot quickly. Some pirates also use this spell to hide their lairs from prying eyes.  
**Otiluke’s Freezing Sphere:** TThis spell can be used to trap a ship in ice, provided you can affect a large enough area. If at least half of the ship is encased in ice, the ship is slowed to one half speed (unless the ice is attached to a landmass, in which case the ship is immobilized) until the ice melts.  
**Rope Trick:** The extradimensional space created by this spell has a fixed position in the material plane of existence. A vehicle can move out from under it, leaving the rope dangling.  
**Sending:** This spell is useful for coordination and communication with multiple ships.  
**Shatter:** This spell can only be used against a single 10-foot section of a ship or one mast of its rigging.  
**Teleport:** When teleporting onto the deck of a ship at sea, your familiarity can never be higher than “viewed once,” unless you are using a permanent circle or associated object, because the ship is moving.  
**True Strike:** The insight bonus granted to attack rolls can be added to attack rolls with ship weapons.  
**Wall of Fire:** This spell _does not_ cause flammable objects within the area of effect to catch fire.  
**Web:** If cast into the rigging of a ship, this spell reduces the vessel's maneuverability rating by one.
