# Chime of Swarm Summoning

_Wondrous item, rare_

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action and summon a swarm of creatures, as if you had cast the _Conjure Swarm_ spell. The chime can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The chime can be used d8 + 2 times. After the last time, it cracks and becomes useless.
