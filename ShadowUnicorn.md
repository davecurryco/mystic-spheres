**Charge.** If the shadow unicorn moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The shadow unicorn's innage spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: _detect evil and good, druidcraft, pass without trace_  
1/day each: _crown of madness, dispel evil and good, spike growth_  

**Displacement.** The shadow unicorn's black coat bends light, causing it to appear to be standing near its actual location, causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage.

**Magic Weapons.** The shadow unicorn's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The shadow unicorn makes two attacks: one with its hooves and one with its horn.

**Hooves.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Horn.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

**Poisoned Touch (3/Day).** As a bonus action, the shadow unicorn can choose to poison a creature it has hit with a hoof or horn attack. The target takes 11 (2d8 + 2) poison damage and must make a saving throw as described for the shadow unicorn's horn attack, even if the creature has already made a such a saving throw on this turn.

**Ethereal Stride.** The shadow unicorn and up to three willing creatures within 5 feet of it magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane of vice versa.

## Legendary Actions

The shadow unicorn can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The shadow unicorn regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Hooves.** The shadow unicorn makes one attack with its hooves.

**Shadow Shield (costs 2 actions).** The shadow unicorn creates a flickering magical field of darkness around itself or another creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target gains a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the shadow unicorn's next turn.

**Harm (costs 3 actions).** The shadow unicorn unleashes a virulent disease on a creature that it can see within 60 feet. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 7d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before the time passes.

## A Shadow Unicorn Herdâ€™s Lair

A herd of shadow unicorns will invariably lair in some dismal, inaccessible wilderness location, such as a dense, primeval forest or a narrow, rocky canyon.

### Regional Effects

Transformed by the creatures' dark fey presence, the domain of a shadow unicorn herd might include any of the following magical effects:

* Light sources of a nonmagical nature such as torches and lanterns refuse to stay lit.
* Creatures native to the shadow unicorns' domain become particularly adept at hiding in shadows; they have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide except when in direct sunlight.
* When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the minimum number of hit points possible for the spell or effect.
* Good aligned creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against curses, diseases and similar spells and magical effects.

If all members of the shadow unicorn herd die, these effects end immediately.

**Shadow Unicorns** were bred by from a nightmare stallion and a unicorn mare. They possess traits drawn from both stocks as well as powers imbued in them by their dark fey breeders. Unlike unicorns, shadow unicorns are not solitary, but run in herds dominated by an alpha mare. Some sages point to this and the effects of shadow unicorn poison as evidence that dark elves of the Dharovin bred the first shadow unicorns.
