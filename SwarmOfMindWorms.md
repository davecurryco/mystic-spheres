## Actions

**Tentacles.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 15 (2dl0 + 4) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.

**Bore into Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the swarm of mind worms. Hit: The target takes 55 (lOdlO) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind worm kills the target by devouring its brain. 

**Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).** The swarm of mind worms magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Mind worms are slimy, greyish-green abominations 24-28 inches long. Their heads are capped with a horrid sucker-like mouth full of sharp teeth surrounded by seven tentacles almost the same length as their bodies. A colony of mind worms infests a large boulder, usually a meteorite, within which the worms have bored an intricate network of tunnels. Although the individual worms in the swarm move around inside the tunnels, they will not leave their hive. The colony forms a collective mind that is quite intelligent, although utterly alien and implacably hostile to all forms of life other than their own.

Survivors of the explosive destruction of some primeval planet, mind worms ride aboard meteors hurtling through space. The worms are adapted to the cold, heat, and vacuum of outer space. Their alien body chemistry makes them immune to earthly poisons. The worms can enter a state of suspended animation at will and emerge from it almost instantly when prey comes within their sensory range.
