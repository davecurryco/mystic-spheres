# Pashan

## Ethnography

The city states of Pashan are populated by humans of an ethnic group called the _Alhrain_. They are darker than the Juchin, but not so swarthy as the Khemez. Like the Khemez many Alhran have curly hair, but it is more often brown than black and their eyes can be grey, green, or even blue in. Their women can be especially striking -- long-lashed, narrow-waisted beauties with lush breasts and hips.

The Alhrain people tend to be energetic and passionate, especially in matters political and religious. They are more inclined to be merchants, sailors, or traders than farmers or herdsmen.
