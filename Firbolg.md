**Firbolgs** are protohumans who made permanent residence in the fey realms many ages ago. They are preternaturally strong and have developed abilities that allow them to escape notice from the magical denizens of the Feywild and defend themselves when avoidance fails. Firbolgs resemble beardless dwarves, except that they are somewhat taller, and generally have huge, crooked noses, pot-bellies, and hunched backs. As with dwarves, firbolg women are seldom seen. Firbolgs live in villages built in huge underground caverns and seldom venture to the surface, at least in part to avoid contact with elves, who they distrust. Firbolgs distrust fomorians even more and often spy on the deformed giants and seek to thwart their schemes, although they assiduously avoid direct conflict.
