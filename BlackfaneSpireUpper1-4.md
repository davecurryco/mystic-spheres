# Blackfane Spire - Upper Levels 1-4

## SU1: The Gallery of Sorrows

This gallery, the first tier of the upper levels, attests both to Tyriana's cultured background as a daughter of Aelvii nobility and her twisted obsessions as an undead. The floor and walls are dressed in white marble, but lit by lamps of crystal that glow with a dim inner light in pale, sickly hues of purple, green, and yellow. Instead of the open archways found on the Catacomb galleries, this level features a solid inner wall. Between the columns are eight white marble daises, each of which holds a life-sized statue covered by a silken drapery.

Each statue is of a diaphanously-gowned and hooded female elf posed to represent one of the Eight Sorrows of the Aelvii. A title is carved in elven script on the base of each.

A) The Enmity of the Aberrants  
The elf-maiden strives against an unseen assailant. She has been half lifted from the ground and her fists are raised as if in an attempt to beat off something that has clutched her by the waist from above.  
Symbol: _Insanity_

B) Exile from the Blessed Lands  
The elf-maiden walks with head bowed. She glances back over her right shoulder in a gesture suggestive of regret.  
Symbol: _Hopelessness_  

C) The Corruption of the Makers  
The maiden is corpulent for an elf. Her curves are accentuated by the lascivious cut of her dress. She lifts a hand-scale of the type used to weigh precious metals and treads a flowering plant carelessly beneath her feet.  
Symbol: _Sleep_  

D) The Shattering  
The maiden bears a naked sword in one hand and her own severed head in the other.  
Symbol: _Pain_  

E) The Servant Revolt  
The maiden grips a ravening mastiff by the throat and struggles to keep it at arms length.  
Symbol: _Fear_  

F) The Sundering  
An elf-maiden stalks away with an angry scowl on her face as her twin stands with arms outstretched in a pleading gesture.  
Symbol: _Discord_  

G) The Cataclysm  
The maiden crouches on her knees and sieves a double handful of dirt or ash through her fingers.  
Symbol: _Stunning_  

H) The Starfall  
The maiden gazes upward with her hands flung upward in a gesture of warding. She wears a look of shock and horror.  
Symbol: _Death_  

The statues are lifelike in every detail, as well they might be since each figure was once a live female elf that Tyrania turned to stone by means of a wand of petrification. The vampiress sees herself as an artist and she conceived of this series of "statues" as a kind of performance art frozen in time. She went to great lengths to select and set up each of her "models" to be in the right pose with the right expression just as they were struck by wand's ray. Her project is one of a very few instances in all of elven art and literature where the Eight Sorrows are actually enumerated. Only the Exile and the Cataclysm are recounted in the popular lore and songs of the elves. The other events are too shameful to be recalled publicly, save for the first, which is ancient beyond record, and the last, which is only foretold in dire prophecy.

Each of the eight statues is enchanted to convey an overpowering emotion to any living creature that views it (in a 30 foot radius). Each emotion has the effect of one of the glyphs of the Symbol spell, as noted in the statue's description. Tyriana's delight is to cover the statues with silk draperies and force a prisoner to unveil one of them on the pretense of soliciting critique.

If Tyriana has warning of the party’s approach (most likely because of the regional effect that gives her warning when a living creature approaches within 100 feet of the spire), she will first confront the adventurers on this level, accompanied by Destran, a **vampire spawn spellcaster**, four **vampire spawn warriors**, and two **imps**. Unless the party is obviously unappeasably hostile, the vampiress will be open to a full range of possibilities concerning them. She might personally attack a good-aligned party she considers weak, leave her minions to deal with a more capable hostile party, bargain with a strong neutral party, or even try to recruit an evil-aligned group she sees as worthy. She will seek to gauge the party’s strength and intentions and exploit them to her own ends.

In a fight, Tyriana and her allies will try to draw the party into range of the statues. The imps will stand by invisibly, ready to snatch away the covers of the statues by means of fine silk cords at their mistress’ command. The vampire spawn will follow Destran’s lead in engaging the party. The vampiress herself may help out with spells, but not if it puts her in any real danger. She will reserve Dimension Door to make her escape.

## SU2: The Fane

The fane is a temple dedicated to the worship of the lords of the infernal planes. Tyriana maintains it and the priests who reside there in homage to her original patron, Azariel. However, the unholy character of the area predates the vampiress or even Gothrog, for that matter. For this reason, the fane has an ambience of ancient, restless evil, even though the construction looks new.

### SU2.1: The Entryway

_The stairs lead to a landing, beyond which more stairs ascend to another level. The landing opens on a large chamber floored in reddish-brown marble. The chamber is lit, albeit dimly, by a large brass chandelier that depends from a brazen chain anchored in the center of the high ceiling. On the wall opposite the landing, two tapestries flank a double-valved door of dark, glossy-finished wood with brass handles in the form of bat-winged creatures. The tapestries are intricately worked with hellish scenes of devils tormenting lost souls amid flames of woe. There are two smaller doors in the walls on either side. A larger-than-life stylized statue of a winged warrior carved in black stone stands beside each door._

This is the entryway to the Fane complex. The two statues are **stone golems**. They are tasked to bar entry to the quarters to any but the priests and acolytes or those in their company (partly to keep the slaves from escape, but mostly to discourage snacking among Tyriana’s spawn). They are Malarynn’s constructs and will obey only his orders. He deliberately created the golems without a control amulet to forestall treachery among his followers.

### SU2.2: The Cistern Chamber

Along one wall of this small chamber, a square shaft in the floor plunges 20 feet to a cistern full of drinking water. The opening of the shaft is protected by a metal grate that has a square hole just large enough to admit a bucket, which stands on the floor nearby. A frame with a pulley permits the bucket to be lowered to the water below. The grate is padlocked and the key is in the keeping of the chief acolyte, along with the rope to the bucket. These arrangements have been found necessary to prevent the slaves from committing suicide.

### SU2.3: The Slaves' Bedchamber

This small chamber is the quarters of the six female **slaves**, when they are not at their duties. The three-kitchen slaves sleep here, while the extra bed and the fur rug on the floor accommodates the bed-slaves on occasions when they are not wanted in the chambers of the priests. For reasons of security, there is no brazier and the room is quite chilly. A shared trunk holds the women’s clothing and other personal items.

The human slave-women are beautiful and obedient. (They are the pick of the captives and are well aware of what fate awaits them if they should displease their masters and be sent to the Pit.)

### SU2.4: The Acolytes’ Bedchamber

This chamber is shared by the three rank-and-file **acolytes**. Like the rest of the level, it is well-constructed of fine materials and workmanship, but in contrast to the priest’s quarters, it is but sparsely furnished. A brazier and a woven rug for warmth and a shared trunk for clothing suffice for the needs of the junior members of the sect.

### SU2.4: The Chief Acolyte’s Bedchamber

The **chief acolyte** has a private bedchamber, but it is considerably more modest that those appointed to the priests. Dangerous items, such as the rope to the cistern-bucket, the key to the cistern-grate, and the kitchen knives are removed to a trunk at the foot of the chief acolyte’s bed at night.

### SU2.5: The Priests' Bedchambers

Each of the three **priests** has a well-appointed private bedchamber. The chambers of the senior priests even boast writing-desks and bookcases.

### SU2.6: The Larder

The door to this chamber is kept locked. The key is also in the keeping of the chief acolyte. Two kegs of good brown ale and two of mead are stacked along one wall and a rack on the other wall holds three dozen bottles of fine wines. Shelves on the wall between hold all manner of spices, preserves, and condiments, while stacks of baskets and crates hold fruits and vegetables of various sorts. Cuts of meat, fresh and smoked, hang from hooks on the wall above a table laden with a large loaf of bread, a pile of sausages, and a basket of mushrooms.

### SU2.7: The Common Room

The **priests** and **acolytes** take their meals and cheer in this chamber, which is lit by a chandelier above the dining table and warmed by a large fireplace. A tapestry depicting nymphs and satyrs taking pleasure in a forest grove stands above a board laden at all times with bread, cheese, cold meats, and fruit. In a corner, a shelf of crockery mugs waits near a tapped keg filled with good ale.

The **chief acolyte** can usually be found sitting in the seat nearest the fireplace, directing the slaves and junior acolytes in the preparation of the next meal, which is never more than a few hours away.

### SU2.8: The Kitchen

There is no door between the common room and this room. The kitchen contains a wood-fired stove and all the other appurtenances one would expect. Among these are a pantry stocked with pies, pastries, and sweetmeats, a rack on one wall for pots and pans, a cupboard that holds fine cups, plates, bowls, and tableware, and a wash-tub which serves double-duty to wash either dishes or clothing.

At least one of the kitchen **slaves** will always be in this chamber -- to tend the stove and common-room fireplace if nothing else.

### SU2.9: The Privy-Chamber

The door to this chamber is shut, but unlocked. It can be bolted from the inside. The floor is covered in tiles of a reddish-brown slate. A large copper tub half-full of water stands in a corner next to the marble-seated, single-hole toilet. A wooden dresser holds a washbasin and pitcher, both of them silver.

### SU2.10: The High Priest's Reception Room

Malarynn receives visitors in this lavishly-furnished room. A decadently plush couch with matching chairs and a low table of gold-inlaid maple, stands atop an expensive carpet woven of dyed wool in the elaborate patterns of far Khanashar. Behind them on the wall is an exquisite, but disturbing, tapestry embroidered with scenes of succubi haunting the dreams of women and men, young and old. A fireplace with a rose-marble mantlepiece, carven and gilded, nestles in a corner-angle, flanked by a supply of firewood on one side and a beautiful, carved maple cabinet on the other. On the wall on either side of the opening of a hallway that leads out of the chamber are two large candle stands of gold-plated silver cast in intricate, but somehow unsettling, embellishments.

### SU2.10: The Maid-Slaves’ Bedchamber

The two female **slaves** dedicated to the high priest’s service share this bedchamber. They are expected to maintain their beauty, so their chamber is well-appointed compared to the quarters of the other slaves. Malarynn is highly self-indulgent, but not capriciously sadistic, as Tyriana is. Rather, he casually assumes that his rights over his inferiors are absolute. The slaves know this and are almost frantic to be useful to the high priest so as not to be chosen as a convenient sacrificial victim or the target of an experimental soul-draining ritual.

### SU2.11: The Man-Slaves’ Bedchamber

Two male **slaves** who wait upon Malarian have their quarters here.

### SU2.12: The High Priest’s Study

Malarynn has his office and library in this richly-furnished chamber. Among the books in his library is a _manual of golems (stone)_, which he keeps on hand in case one of his creations should be destroyed. To one side of his writing-desk is an elaborately-carved mahogany cabinet in which the high priest keeps components for inscribing rituals as well as mundane writing supplies. Atop this is a gilded orc-skull that has been pressed into service as a candle-holder. Close examination of the skull will reveal a circle of dwarf-runes incised around its crown. This is the _Skull of Oaths_, which, by great coincidence, came to Malarynn through his contacts with slave traders in the service of Quetra and the Red Mages in Delastarion. The high priest was a frequent patron of the Orc Hunt in his younger days and he keeps the skull as a memento.

### SU2.13: The Dining Chamber

Malarynn entertains his guests and takes his regular meals in this lavish dining chamber. Four plush dining couches surround a table of inlaid marble. Rich tapestries adorn the wall opposite the main door. A brazier and two wall-lanterns provide a cheery light. A richly-finished hardwood cabinet on one wall holds fine dishes, utensils, and linens.

### SU2.14: The High Priest’s Bedchamber

The high priest’s taste for luxury finds full expression in his personal bedchamber. The large bed has silk sheets and woolen blankets to ward off the chill that permeates the spire. A masterwork rug from Khanashar graces the floor and matching hardwood furniture is tastefully arranged around the room. Along with the wardrobe and dresser that stand along the walls, an ornate chest-of-drawers stands beside the bed. A false back to this conceals a secret compartment in the wall in which Malarynn keeps his personal treasure.

A man in Malarynn’s position is well-advised to trust no one, and this chamber is designed for security as well as luxury. The hardwood door is bound with gilded fittings, but has a steel core and can be bolted from the inside. The high priest always casts guardian of faith before he goes to sleep for the night and directs the spectral guardian to occupy the spaces nearest the center of the room at the foot of his bed, from which it can command the entire chamber.

### SU2.15: The High Priest’s Privy-Chamber

This room is designed for security as well as its more usual functions. The door is of the same type as the main door of the bedchamber and a one-way secret  door opens outward to the sanctum to provide an escape route. Even the short hallway between the bedchamber and the privy-chamber is trapped to slow down pursuit in case the Malarynn’s private space should be invaded.

The round, copper-lined marble tub in this chamber is of particular interest among the lavish furnishings in this room. Its lip is inscribed with runes that draw from the elemental plane of fire to warm the water in the tub.

The shaving-stand holds a masterwork porcelain basin and ewer chased with gold leaf, along with fine shaving utensils and costly unguents and medicines. A silvered mirror in a gilded frame hangs on the wall above it. The floor is warmed by a costly Khanashari rug.

### SU2.16: The Ritual Chamber

Worshippers who would enter the sanctum must ritually defile themselves as an expression of their subservience to the lords of the infernal planes. This chamber is equipped for the purpose. A fountain of black marble dominates the center of the room. From a central sculpture depicting tormented souls writing beneath the torments of devils, an unpleasant-smelling, darkly opalescent, oily liquid trickles down to pool in the basin. The liquid is, of course, unholy water. The fountain is surrounded by a magic circle permanently incised in the dark marble floor, which is used in the ritual pollution of the water.

A table of dark stone holds a short sword of black iron, cast all of one piece, atop a purple silk table-piece fringed and embroidered in gold thread. There are also two unlit, red candles flanking the table-piece. A silver hand-bell with an ebony handle lies to one side. These implements are used in the ritual of defilement.

A large wardrobe of black-stained wood with fittings of black iron stands along the wall. Hanging inside are black robes with red-lined cowls for use by the worshippers.

Flanking the black iron door that leads to the Sanctum are two large statues of multi-headed monstrosities with bat wings and wicked-looking claws. These loom behind black iron braziers that blaze with sulfurous-smelling red flames.

### SU2.17: The Sanctum

Inside the doors is a great hall or nave with tall columns and high arches upholding the vaulted ceiling. Although the architecture is decidedly elvish and the nave is lofty and spacious, the bleached-bone color of the stones and the complete lack of windows gives the place the feel of a tomb. At one end is a domed apse, beneath which stands a stone table that consists of a great slab of black stone that rests on two smaller slabs. The table is surrounded by a circle of fell runes incised into the black marble floor. Along the wall of the nave stand candelabra racks that hold tier upon tier of red candles. Overhead are massive chandeliers alight with larger candles of the same sort. The candles burn with a dim, yellowish light that barely illuminates the apse and leaves the vaults of the nave in deep shadow.

If a general alarm has been raised, Malarynn, the evil **high priest** of the black fane, will be present to defend the unholy altar. He will be accompanied by three **priests** of the black fane, four **acolytes**, and a **horned devil** he has summoned. **Destran** may well make a tactical retreat to this place if he is overmatched in the gallery below. If the party has arrived by stealth, Malarynn and his underlings will be in their quarters and the cleric will have had no time to summon aid.

The stone table is, of course, an altar consecrated to evil. The magic circle surrounding it channels unholy energies that enable the high priest or his acolytes to harness the dark powers of the fiend-lords they worship.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties) the priest takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* The altar becomes the center of a hallow spell with a duration of 10 minutes. The priest can choose the affected creature types and extra effect. The priest need not concentrate to maintain this effect.
* A sphere of magical darkness 20 feet in diameter radiates from the altar. The darkness totally obscures its area and anything within it. Evil-aligned creatures within the sphere are immune to its effects. The darkness immediately extinguishes normal light sources in its area and cannot be penetrated by magical light from a spell of 3rd level or less. Each non-evil aligned creature in the area of darkness when it appears or that starts its turn there must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 12 (3d8) points of necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The darkness lasts until the beginning of initiative count 20 on the next round.
* The priest can attempt to summon aid from the infernal realms. The summoned creature appears in an unoccupied square outside the magic circle and is treated as an ally of the priest unless a critical failure results. The result of the summons are determined by a d20 roll: 1 = critical failure; 2-3 = summons fails; 4-6 trivial devil; 7-11 minor devil; 12-16 devil; 17-19 major devil, 20 = pit fiend. On a critical failure, roll again to determine the type of devil summoned. If the summons fails on this second roll, the offending priest is affected as if by a banishment spell.

## SU3: The Guest Halls

This level is designed as secure quarters for Tyriana to entertain her guests - willing or unwilling.

### SU3.1 The Grand Ballroom

The stairway landing opens onto a mezzanine above a large ballroom with a floor of polished marble. Stairs descend from the mezzanine to the ballroom floor around a semi-circular balcony tiled with gray quartzite, reddish-brown porphyry, and rose marble. The arched ceiling is stuccoed and painted to resemble a twilight sky. Marble columns decorated with gold leaf support  the arches, from which descend four massive chandeliers, gilded and ornate and alight with gold candles. Intricate tapestries embroidered in elven motifs hang on the walls between the columns. The effect is festive, but in a stiff, formal way.

On the opposite wall, a stepped platform rises from the ballroom floor to a stage beneath the semi-dome of an alcove. The ballroom is empty, but after a few seconds, you notice a soft music on the edge of hearing that echoes faintly from its arches. This gradually grows louder until you can pinpoint its source. The music rises from the stage, apparently amplified by the dome. However, you see no musicians or even instruments that might be its source.

Tyriana retains the trappings of her life as a noble of the Illuvarin. Among her many self-indulgences in this regard is that she has constructed a great hall for dancing and other entertainments, both cultured and savage. The spirits of those elven men and women slain here for the amusement of the vampiress and her guests are bound to haunt this place, as the adventurers will discover as soon as any of them descends to the ballroom floor.

As you step out onto the polished marble, the border of each the tapestries seems to glow with a witchy light and the spectral forms of elven men and women dressed in costly raiment stride out onto the ballroom floor as well. The apparitions of elven musicians playing phantasmal instruments slowly appear on the stage. The tune they play is clear now and distinct. It has the unmistakable, enchanting lyrical quality of elven melody, but with a distinct, regular rhythm. The spirits array themselves in two rows, one of men and one of women, and then begin a slow, courtly dance in time to the music from the stage. Neither they nor the musicians seem to heed you in the slightest. It is as if they are in another time.

The dancers are 12 **ghosts**, and the musicians number another 4 **ghosts**. They will not attack or interfere with the adventurers unless they themselves are attacked.

### SU3.2 The Guest Apartments

Tyriana houses visitors of note in the lavish apartments in this section of the spire. The rich trappings and luxurious amenities are intended to impress visiting dignitaries with the vampiress’ power as Gothrog’s favored lieutenant. Tyriana also intends that the moans and screams that can occasionally be heard from the adjoining dungeons leave an impression of a different kind.

This suite of chambers is currently occupied by Lord Gamesh, a **rakshahsa** posing as a noble from Ophar, and his retinue. Gamesh is, in fact, a broker for a consortium of Ophari slave-traders. Gamesh has supplied Tyriana with many of the unfortunate wretches trapped in the Black Pit. Tyriana is well aware of his true nature and has invited him to Blackfane Spire to impress him with her connections to the Dark Fey Powers and the Princes of the Infernal Planes. The two of them are in negotiations to dramatically scale up this supply. Gamesh does not know why, but he guesses well enough since Tyriana has been particularly interested in captive warriors as well as the usual run of commoner men and women kept as cattle for the vampire spawn to feed from.

Gamesh is an intelligent, highly charismatic, and resourceful fiend, so the disposition of the hallway and chambers in this section of the spire will depend on whether he has been been alerted to danger.

**_No Alert_**  
The double-doors leading to the apartments from the mezzanine are unlocked, but are guarded by two weretiger bodyguards of Lord Garmesh’s retinue. They carry crossbows with silver-tipped bolts instead of the usual longbow and have assumed their hybrid form so as to look more intimidating. They are quite on edge from the uncanny atmosphere of the spire so they are alert to the slightest sign that something might be amiss.

**_Alert_**  
There are no guards on the mezzanine and the double-doors to the hallway are barred from within.

#### SU3.2.1 Hallway

_**No Alert**_  
The hallway is empty.

_**Alert**_  
Gamesh will cast invisibility on himself and stand at the far end of the hall. He intends to cast major image just before assailants break through the double door. The manner of image Gamesh creates will depend on what he knows of the circumstances. If he is trying to learn more, Gamesh will use the image much like mislead -- to create an illusory duplicate of his human appearance standing 10 feet down the hallway from the doors to see how the party will react to him. He will dissemble and negotiate through this image as necessary and will signal his bodyguard to attack if it is unmasked as an illusion. If he seeks to dissuade attackers, Gamesh will create an image of an iron archway that takes up the entire width and height of the hallway 15 feet down from the doors. He will embellish the illusion to give every indication that it is an interplanar portal to one of the Nine Hells. If the adventurers actually attempt to go through the portal, four of Gamesh’s bodyguard will attack from their apartment.

#### SU3.2.2 Bodyguard Apartment

Lord Gamesh’s **weretiger** bodyguards share this apartment.

_**No Alert**_  
Two off-duty weretigers will be sleeping in this room.

_**Alert**_  
Four weretiger bodyguards will be waiting inside the door of the apartment, ready to attack on Lord Gamesh’s signal.

#### SU3.2.3 Lady Shasheera's Apartment

In order to keep up appearances, Lord Gamesh usually travels with a beautiful female **slave** masquerading as his wife. These are generally educated daughters of wealthy Ophari merchants, seduced and kidnapped by Gamesh’s agents. Gamesh delights in terrorizing a beauty into submission, parading her around for a few months, and suddenly turning on her and devouring her.

One such is “Lady Shasheera” the nineteen-year-old daughter of a silk merchant. Her real name is Jasrain. She only knows that Gamesh is cruel and capable of sadistic violence, but she does not guess his real nature. In fact, she is so cowed that she actually views Gamesh as a protector and has even begun to fall in love with him. Her **maid**, Sakrit, an older woman, is under no such illusion. She fully realizes that Gamesh is literally an inhuman monster, even if she doesn’t know exactly what kind. However, as she was born into a lower caste, Sakrit is fatalistic about her situation and that of her charge. She prays devoutly to the gods and believes that they will save her and Jasrain if that is their will.

_**No Alert**_  
The two **commoner** women will be in this apartment. Sakrit will be brushing Jasrain’s long, wavy, black hair.

_**Alert**_  
The **women** will be huddled together on the bed, guarded by the two **weretigers** from the adjoining apartment.

There is a niche concealed behind a tapestry on the wall opposite the door, but it is empty.

#### SU3.2.4 Lord Gamesh’s Apartment

_**No Alert**_  
Napoori will be in this room, tidying her master’s belongings.

**Alert**  
The room will be empty of occupants.

The apartment drips with decadent luxuriy.

Gamesh’s personal treasure is in a coffer set within a niche hidden behind a tapestry on the wall opposite the door:

* 1,100 GP
* 500 PP

#### SU3.2.5 Gamesh’s Slaves Apartment

Lord Gamesh’s personal slaves share this small chamber, near to hand if their master or any of his higher-status servants needs anything.

_**No Alert**_  
The slaves will be attending on Lord Gamesh.

_**Alert**_  
The slaves will be in this room. If adventurers free them, they will be reluctant to leave the room unless they are convinced that Lord Gamesh is truly defeated.

The slaves, a human male named Murtha and a human female named Napoori, are commoners from Ophar, who were sold into slavery as children for the debts of their parents. They are terrified of the rakshasha. Murtha saw Gamesh in his hybrid form once, and although he has not told anyone directly, he has hinted to Nanpoori that their master is a devil. The slaves are unaware that Gamesh intends to leave them as a parting gift to Tyriana on his departure.

### SU3.4 The Guest Accommodations

Tyriana provides luxury accommodations to her privileged guests. Currently, Lord Gamesh and his retinue are the only guests who are using these facilities.

The states of alert that apply to the guest apartments apply to these chambers as well.

#### SU3.4.1 The Drawing Room

This chamber is decorated in lavish style and has a warm, inviting fireplace filled with eternal flame channeled from the elemental plane of fire. Lord Gamesh spends his leisure hours here in preference to his apartment, as it is one of the few places in the spire that is not permeated with a damp chill.

_**No Alert**_  
Gamesh will be in this room, at his ease in an armchair enjoying a smoke from a hookah and a glass of good elven wine. He will be attended by Murta.

_**Alert**_  
The rakshasa will defend the hallway as previously indicated.

#### SU3.4.2 The Game Parlor

This room is furnished with tables for games of various sorts by means of which guests may entertain themselves. One of these tables is obviously meant for games of chance, as it has a central well in which are kept tokens of ivory, ebony, and teak along with ivory dice and writing supplies. The other table features a miniature walled city and its surrounds along with numerous stands of figures cast in silver that represent knights and footmen. This war game set is actually an ancient scale model of the Citadel of Asarial that was used by Azruun generals to plan the Siege of Asarial.

#### SU3.4.3 The Dining Chamber

Tyriana invites her guests to take their meals in this large and impressively-decorated room and sometimes joins them here, although she never eats in anyone else’s presence. It is furnished with ornate chandeliers, marble-topped tables, and elven-style dining-couches covered in rich brocade. A wide, open floor-space in the center of the room covered with a large Khanashari carpet is used as a stage for entertainers of various sorts during  fetes.

### SU3.3 The Dungeons

Prisoners in whom Tyriana has a special interest are brought here for imprisonment and torture by the slowest and cruelest methods that the depraved mind of an undead fey can devise. She takes a twisted delight in the notion that only a short passageway and an iron door separate the decadent luxury of the guest quarters from the nightmarish horror of her torture chambers.

#### SU3.3.1 The Guardroom

Access to the cells is controlled by the guards in this chamber, two **iron hellhounds** created for Tyriana by Unrad, Gothrog’s duergar artificer. The hounds will only allow Tyriana or those she has specifically authorized to pass. Their technique for this is very simple. The iron door is barred from the inside, but has a reinforced hole just large enough to admit the hand and forearm of a medium humanoid. On hearing a creature outside the door, one of the hounds will growl a warning and place its mouth, metal fangs bared, just inside the hole. A creature that wishes to pass must place its hand inside the hound’s mouth so that the hound may identify the creature by taste. If the hound doesn’t recognize the creature it simply bites down. Otherwise, the second hound noses a large target shield that hangs on the wall opposite the door. This action triggers a lever that unbars the door.

#### SU3.3.2 Vanadel’s Cell

Vanadel is a elven **knight-errant** of the Alyaquende sent by Lord and Lady Ceredin and Caelynneth on a quest to find a means to defeat the dragon Varog, who has ensconced herself in the formerly fair city of Laessinia. He was captured by Tyriana’s spies on the border of the Trollfells and taken to Blackfane Spire to be tortured for information. After a long, heroic resistance, Vanadel was broken and revealed all he knew. Tyriana keeps him in this cell in the hope that shame and temptation will push him over to the side of darkness.

The paladin sits with his head low in squalor on one side of the cell. A female **vampire spawn** lounges lasciviously on a luxurious couch on the other side. A small table at her elbow holds a crystal decanter of pale wine, two gold-rimmed crystal drinking-cups, and a tray of sweetmeats. Vanadel knows that all he has to do to be released is to accept the proffered temptations.

#### SU3.3.3 Allura’s Cell

The door to this cell is unlocked. A filthy, blood-soaked bearskin lies on the cold, stone flags.

#### SU3.3.4 The Torture Chamber

This chamber has everything the well-equipped inquisitor needs to apply enhanced interrogation techniques to extrajudicial prisoners — or just for fun.

Tyriana holds Allura, a high-level **druid** of the Order of the Briar, in this torture chamber. The feverish, barely-conscious druidess is strapped tightly to an upright frame of iron. A bloodleech vine wraps around her body, its vampiric tendrils embedded in her flesh. From time to time, Tyriana will drop by to rip her captive away from the vine, gloat in the searing pain this causes, and drag her away to her cell to heal until the next bout. Allura’s bare skin bleeds from dozens of shallow, jagged wounds, for the detached tendrils always reattach on undamaged flesh. In this way, the vampiress keeps her captive in a delirium of pain, while preventing the vine from killing her. Allura is currently at exhaustion level 5 from this treatment — almost at the point of death. It amuses Tyriana to thus torment a druidess with a perversion of nature — so much so that the vampiress has yet to ask Allura a single question. However, Tyriana might act differently if she had any inkling that Allura knows where the much-sought sapling is to be found.

In a black-curtained, iron cage in an alcove, a **dark one** spy captured while skulking around the Ring hangs suspended in heavy chains. This creature of darkness squirms in torment as harsh light from a _Gem of Brightness_ hung from the roof of the cage shines in his eyes, which are held open by a fiendish contraption of leather and iron fitted on his head. The Gem of Brightness, which was taken from Vanadel, has 5 charges left.

Tyriana’s official torturer, a **duergar enforcer** named Grazt, stands near the cage with an hourglass in his hand, counting the seconds of the dark one’s torment. Deformed from many decades spent in contact with the Fomorians, Grazt is hunchbacked, lame, and ill-favored -- even for a duergar. For all that, he is a gifted inquisitor. Gothrog sent Grazt to Tyriana, partly to assist her, but also to ensure that any secrets wrested from her prisoners reach his ears as well.

In one corner of the chamber stands a particularly tall, well-built v**ampire spawn warrior**, fully-armed and vigilant. Tyriana has particularly charged him to see that Grazt is never alone with the prisoners.

## SU4: The Servant Chambers

Those **vampire spawn** and other creatures highest in Tyriana’s trust have crypt-like chambers on this level. The vampiress’ menial **servants** dwell here too. Among the latter are a number of handsome mortal men reserved for Tyriana’s lusts.

### SU4.1 Duergar Chambers

Unrad and his assistants dwell in these chambers.

#### SU4.1.1 Unrad’s Apartment

The **artificer** occupies this room when he is not busy elsewhere in the Spire. The room is appointed with well-crafted furnishings, but it is a shambles. The desk is strewn with papers, writing implements, samples of minerals, and drafting tools. The workbench on the opposite wall is cluttered with beakers, crucibles, glass bottles, burners, metal parts, cogs, and various tools. Piles of books, scrolls, tablets, and maps litter the shelves of a bookcase along one wall. Although most of this is junk there are a few items that are worth something:

* A gold bird cage with electrum filigree (250 GP) that contains the dessicated remains of a canary
* A dodecahedron constructed of silver rods, within which a ball of chalcedony hangs suspended by fine silver chains (250 GP).
* A gold napkin-ring set with bloodstones and monogrammed with the dwarf-runes for M and Z (250 GP)
* An ornate silver tankard (250 GP)
* A bronze crown with still partly encased in a lost-wax mold (250 GP)

At the foot of the bed is a chest, ornately decorated in the dark motifs favored by the duergar. This is actually an animated strongbox placed here as a decoy with instructions to attack anyone who attempts to move or open it. It contains a small amount of treasure for the sake of misdirection:

* 230 GP
* 2 PP

Unrad actually keeps his personal treasure in a lead-lined compartment cleverly built into the headboard of his bed. The compartment can be discovered with a successful Wisdom (Perception) DC 20 check, but it is locked. A successful Wisdom(Perception) DC 20 check will reveal that the compartment is locked with a puzzle-lock that involves twisting the bed-knobs on the headboard. A successful Intelligence(Investigation) DC 20 check will reveal that the compartment is trapped, although the nature of the trap is not clear. A successful Intelligence(Investigation) DC 25 check will allow a player to discover the combination of moves that unlocks the compartment. If this last check fails, or if the compartment is opened by force, a mechanical trigger will detonate an explosive charge that fills the room with shrapnel from the headboard. Each creature in the room must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d10 of fire damage, 5d10 of force damage, and 5d10 of piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The blast will destroy the items in the compartment, shred everything in the room, and extinguish the brazier and candelabra, plunging the chamber into darkness. The compartment contains:

* 600 EP
* 600 GP
* 10 PP
* 16 500 GP gems (3 peridot, 6 black pearl, 4 topaz, 3 blue spinel)
* Potion of flying
* Potion of supreme healing
* Nolzur’s marvelous pigments

### SU4.2 Glazdrina's Apartment

Glazdrina spends most of her time outside the Spire, at work in the caverns and dungeons of the Ring. When she has need of rest, she takes it in this apartment. Her restless and spiteful spirit is on full display here. The chambers are sweltering hot from the combined output of two iron braziers kept ablaze at all times. The expensive carpet is stained, muddied, and burnt in patches from having hot coals from the nearby brazier dropped on it. What was a beautiful tapestry has been defaced and has several long slashes from Glazdrina’s nails. The wreckage of a chair lies in the corner by the door, where the cambion smashed in a rage. The bed is rumpled and unmade and clothes litter the floor of the bedroom. The candelabra is unlit. The walls are covered in infernal symbols, obscure sayings, and rambling screeds. Some are scrawled in ink, some in charcoal, and a few (especially the symbols) are in blood.

Glazdrina’s personal treasure is hidden beneath the false bottom of the wardrobe in the bedroom. The compartment requires a successful Wisdom(Perception) DC 12 to find:

* 1,400 SP
* 2,300 GP
* 2 large gold bracelets (250 GP)
* 1 brass censor inlaid with silver and semi-precious stones (250 GP)
* Potion of invisibility

### SU4.3 The Tombs

Among Tyriana’s most loyal and powerful servants are elven wights — Dharovin nobles who were members of a cult that sought dark powers here at the juxtaposition of planes and were cursed to an eternal existence between death and life because of the forbidden knowledge they gained. Although they are not vampires, these malevolent creatures have tombs on this level in which they rest while they await their mistress’s summons.

#### SU4.3.1 The Elven Wights' Tombs

The two largest tombs are the resting-places of two **elven wights**, who were known in life as Lord Ancalimar and Lady Esselya. The two chambers and the sarcophagi within are nearly identical, except for the names carven above the stone doors and the tapestries that hang on the wall opposite. Each tapestry is embroidered with a life-size image of the tomb’s occupant. Lord Ancalimar is depicted wearing a breastplate and a long mantle and holding a spear in one hand and lifting a hooded and tasseled hunting falcon in the other. Lady Esselya is shown in a gown of purple trimmed in white fur with a belt of gold. She bears a white staff in her left hand. Neither figure seems particularly sinister.

Inside the sarcophagi are identical coffins of dark-stained walnut carved and inlaid with gold leaf and fitted with gold-plated furnishings. The elven wights will be in these coffins unless Tyriana has called them to her side or an alarm has been raised. The lord and lady each wear items of costly jewelry:

_**Lord Ancalimar**_  
* A gold medallion set with a black pearl on a gold chain (500 GP)
* A gold ring set with an alexandrite (500 GP)

_**Lady Esselya**_  
* A platinum necklace set with 6 fire opals (6,000 GP)
* A platinum bracelet set with 4 star rubies (4,000 GP)
* A platinum ring set with 3 yellow sapphires (3,000 GP)

#### SU4.3.2 The Wights' Crypts

The two smaller, less ornate crypts adjoining the Lord and Lady’s tombs are those of two wights -- the nobles’ man and maid servants, respectively. These are exceptional individuals who have maximum hit points for their type. The two servants accompany their masters everywhere and will only be resting inside their stone coffins if the nobles are resting in theirs.

#### SU4.3.3 The Vampire Spawn’s Crypts

The four crypts opposite the wights’ crypts house the coffins of two male vampire spawn warriors and two female vampire spawn spellcasters. These are exceptional individuals who have maximum hit points for their type. Like the wights, the vampire spawn will only be resting in their coffins if Tyriana has not called them to her side.

### SU4.4 The Kitchen Rooms

Tyriana’s mortal guests, servitors, and prisoners must eat, even if she herself does not. According to her penchant for doing everything in high style, the vampiress keeps a full kitchen stocked with the best of food and drink and staffed by gourmet cooks.

#### SU4.4.1 The Taproom

A rack in this room contains two kegs of beer, two of red wine, two of ale, and two of mead. Each of the brews is very good and the wine is drinkable, but not polished.

#### SU4.4.2 The Wine Cellar

This room is kept locked and the key is with the chief butler. It contains seven wooden racks. Four of these are laden with 36 bottles of fine wine each. Some of these are vintages of the southern kingdoms, some are from Rothannur, and others are from Essealonea. Some of the bottles bear labels written in elven script, although it is not clear what vineyard or winery produced them. A fifth rack holds 12 ceramic crocks with lids sealed with wax that contain rice wine. Two more racks hold four large amphorae each. These are filled with a vile fungus wine favored by the fomorians.

#### SU4.4.3 The Pantries

These small rooms are stocked with things to eat. Most of them are delicious, but there are a few unrecognizable, foul-smelling items that are comfort food for the fomorians and duergar.

#### SU4.4.4 The Kitchen

This large chamber is equipped with two stoves, each with an oven compartment, and two large tables for food preparation. There are shelves of herbs, spices, condiments, and other cooking ingredients along the walls on either side. On the back wall are two dumbwaiters, which descend to the Drawing Room and Game Parlor below.

The kitchen is staffed by seven commoner kitchen slaves. Four of these are scullions, two are cooks, and a head cook supervises them all. The slaves scurry to and fro, busy with the preparation of the menu for the mortals, which they know is the only thing that keeps them off the menu for the undead.

### SU4.5 The Slaves’ Quarters

Favored mortal slaves have shared apartments in this section of the Servants’ Chambers. These halls are guarded around the clock, not so much to prevent the slaves’ escape as to discourage predation. The guards are cultists of the Black Fane, recruited by Malarynn from his homeland.

#### SU4.5.1 The Guardroom

Two swarthy, tatooed **veterans** armed with magical (+2) scimitars and shortswords are on duty in this room at all times. Each of them wears a large silver medallion on a silver chain around his neck. The medallions bear the design of a coiled hooded cobra surrounded by a ring of arcane symbols. The medallions are enchanted with a _protection from evil and good_ spell by virtue of their having been “blessed” on the unholy altar in the Fane. The enchantment lasts 24 hours and is renewed daily by Malarynn's acolytes.

The door to this room is barred from the inside. A covered peephole in the door allows the guards to admit only authorized visitors.

#### SU4.5.2 The Guards’ Chamber

Under normal conditions, another two off-duty **veteran** guards will be sleeping in this chamber. If any ruckus is raised in the Guardroom, they will join the fray after three rounds, unarmored except for large shields (AC 14). However, if a general alarm has been raised, they will be awake and wearing armor and able to respond in a single round.

The guard’s weapons are kept in a rack on one wall and their personal treasure is kept in one of two the locked (DC 12) trunks at the foot of their beds:

* 160 SP, 30 EP
* 160 GP
* 260 SP, 30 GP
* 170 SP, 60 GP

#### SU4.5.3 The Guard Captain’s Chamber

If there has been no alarm, the captain of the guard, a **gladiator** named Ankresh will be awake in this chamber, sitting on the edge of his bed with a tankard of ale in his hand and a bottle of stronger stuff at hand on the chest nearby. The things he has seen in his duties here in the Spire have Ankresh very much on edge. If even so much as the sound of raised voices comes from the Guardroom, he will snatch up his weapons and join the fray the next round. If a general alarm has been raised, he will be wearing armor as well.

Ankresh carries two +1 spears and bears a +2 magical shield. He also wears a +2 magical longsword. Around his neck is a medallion of protection of the same type as that issued to the guards in the Guardroom. To this, he has added a gold medallion on a red silk cord. The medallion, which is fashioned in the form of a hand with an all-seeing eye in its palm, is a charm of protection common in Hannenar. It would seem that, even as a devotee of the Black Fane, Ankresh feels the need to hedge his bets in a place like this.

The chest is locked (Dexterity DC 12 with thieves' tools to open). It contains Ankresh’s personal treasure:

* 220 SP, 80 GP

#### SU4.5.4 The Male Slave’s Apartments

These chambers house four male **commoners** — handsome young men reserved for Tyriana’s delectation. They are well-cared for, but are nonetheless captives destined for a cruel fate. The door s locked from the outside (Dexterity DC 15 with thieves' tools to open).

#### SU4.5.4 The Female Slave’s Apartments

These chambers house two female **commoners** — beautiful young women reserved for sacrifice in the Fane. They are well-cared for, but are nonetheless captives destined for a cruel fate. The door is locked from the outside (Dexterity DC 15 with thieves' tools to open).
