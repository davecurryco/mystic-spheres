# The Heart of Abbathor

_Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)_

An enormous, bizarrely-faceted green gemstone, the _Heart of Abbathor_ is named for the dwarven god of greed. This artifact empowers its wielder to achieve his deepest desires, but seems always to corrupt and betray them.

**Random Properties.** The Heart of Abbathor has the following random properties:

* 1 minor beneficial property  
* 1 major beneficial property  
* 1 minor detrimental property  

These properties are randomly chosen when you first become attuned to the gem and may be different for each creature that attunes to it.

**Spells.** The gem has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the gem, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: _charm person_ or _disguise self_ (1 charge); _detect thoughts_, _invisibility_, or _clairvoyance_ (2 charges); _contact other plane_, _creation_, or _dominate person_ (3 charges); _find the path_ (5 charges).
You can also use an action to cast the _command_ spell from the gem without using any charges.

**Avarice.** When you first become attuned to the _Heart of Abbathor_, you must choose a personal goal that, if achieved, will be directly beneficial only to you, not others. Your choice is subject to the discretion of the DM. This goal becomes your _avarice_, the focus for your use of the gem.

**Holy Symbol.** If you are an evil cleric or paladin dedicated to Abbathor, you can use the gem as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

**Influence.** If you are attuned to the gem, you gain advantage on Charisma(Persuasion) and Charisma(Deception) checks made in pursuit of your avarice. If attunement ever ends, you suffer disadvantage on these skill checks until this effect is undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.

**Ability Enhancement.** If you are attuned to the gem, one of your ability scores is treated as 18 for purposes of determining your bonus to ability checks. This enhancement does not apply to saving throws, attack rolls, damage rolls, or any bonus other than ability checks. You must select which of your ability scores will benefit when you first become attuned to the gem. This should be the ability that is most likely to help achieve your avarice, subject to the discretion of the DM.

**Curse.** If you ever achieve your avarice, you will suffer a calamity in which you lose all benefits of your achievement. The form of the calamity and the effects of losing the benefits are at the discretion of the DM.

**Destroying the Heart of Abbathor.** The only way to destroy the Heart of Abbathor is for a creature that is attuned to the gem to perform an act of utter self-sacrifice diametrically opposed to the creature’s avarice. This act must directly benefit some other creature or creatures that cannot repay the act in any way. The sacrificial act need not result in the attuned creature’s death, but must have permanent, radical consequences for the creature’s way of life. For example, a creature that chose the goal of becoming a nation's richest citizen when it first attuned to the Heart of Abbathor might repent and anonymously give all its wealth to a foundation that benefits the nation's impoverished widows and orphans.
If the conditions are met, the gem will explode into hundreds of small shards. Even if so destroyed, the Heart of Abbathor will still be dangerous, as each shard has the potential to prick a creature that comes into contact with it. If a shard does this, it will embed itself in the wound and work its way to the creature’s heart, where it will infect the creature with a controlling desire for something it cannot have. A shard has no other powers and its effect can be countered with any spell effective against curses. The shards are as hard as diamonds, but can be destroyed by ordinary means, such as with a disintegrate spell.
If the creature responsible for the destruction of the Heart of Abbathor later reneges on its sacrificial act, the gem will reform as long as even a single shard remains. For example, if the creature in the previous example later took control of the foundation and used the funds for its own benefit, the shards of the Heart of Abbathor would reassemble on the matrix of the creature’s continuing greed, although not necessarily in the creature’s possession.
