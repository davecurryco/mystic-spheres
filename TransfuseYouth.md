You touch another creature of your race, willing or not, and drain its life-force into your body. The target creature dies and your age decreases by 15% (3d10) of the life-expectancy of that type of creature. Each time you cast this spell, there is a 10% chance that you will die and be instantly transformed into a vampire.
