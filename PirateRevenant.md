# The Pirate Revenant

## Introduction

Koju Kishina, formerly captain of the pirate ship Black Dawn, was murdered by his first mate, Makala-Koho. Due to the influence of a nearby evil artifact, the drowned man came back as a **revenant**. However, Makala now plies the seas as captain of the Black Dawn. To get close enough to exact revenge, Captain Kishina recruits the adventurers. To win their aid, he tells them that if they help him kill Makala, one of them may bear his family sword with honor.

## The Black Dawn

**Captain:** Makala-Koho (Pirate Veteran, Aili) (Amusement/Condescending/Olive)  
_Maka is dark-skinned even for an Aili. He is intelligent and easily bored, which led him to a life of adventure on the seas. He slakes his thirst for excitement with mayhem in combat and acts of torture and rape afterward. Without Captain Kishina's restraining hand, there is little to stop him from slaughtering everyone aboard a captured vessel these days. On shore leave, he is the type to pick a fight that results in the burning of a tavern, or an entire village. The hands aboard the ship regard Maka with a mixture of awe and fear._

**Galley (Bireme)**

**Cargo:** 2 tons and 22 marines  
**Crew:** 62 crew (rabble) / 12 officers  

**Weapons:** 3 ballista (shot, chain) port & starboard / 1 ballista fore & aft / 0 amidships
