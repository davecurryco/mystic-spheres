# Create Greater Undead

_9th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 GP black onyx stone for each corpse)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose one corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. The corpse becomes a powerful undead. You can create one death knight, mummy lord, vampire, or wraith lord with this spell. Creatures so created are not under your control, but are bound to serve you for 30 days.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. The creature is not hostile to you and obeys both the letter and spirit of your instructions. Once the term of service is complete, the creature becomes free-willed and will follow its nature, which might result in it turning hostile toward you, becoming your faithful servant for eternity, or anything in between.
