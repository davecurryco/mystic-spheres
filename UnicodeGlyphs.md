# Unicode Glyphs

Unicode glyphs are symbols present in modern fonts which are outside the normal range of characters that can be entered directly from a keyboard.

Some of them are pretty cool, and can come in handy for formatting text documents:

* ✔ Tick
* ✘ Cross
* ★ Star
* ☐ Unchecked box
* ☑ Checked box
* ☒ Cancelled box
* ☺ Smiley face
* ☹ Frowney face
* ☠ Skull & crossbones

If they're a bit hard to see, you can make them larger using HTML `<big>` tags: <big>☺</big>.
