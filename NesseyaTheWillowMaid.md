## Actions

**Drowning Embrace.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 13 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The attack automatically hits a creature charmed by the naiad. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and pulled 5 feet toward the naiad. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the naiad tries to drown it, and the naiad can’t embrace another target.

**Fey Charm.** The naiad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her (or 60 feet if the creature is touching a body of water that the naiad is also touching). If the target can see the naiad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the naiad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the naiad’s control, it takes the naiad’s requests of actions in the most favorable way it can.  
Each time the naiad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the naiad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If the target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the naiad’s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.  
The naiad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.

## Legendary Actions

**Bestow a Boon or Curse.** Once per day Nesseya can innately cast an additional spell, which can only target another creature. Nesseya has one spell that can be used in this way: _divination_.

**Water Portal.** Once a day on her turn, the naiad can use 10 feet of her movement to submerge herself in a body of water within her reach and emerge from that body of water at a distant spot, appearing in an unoccupied space no further than 5 feet from the water. The naiad can travel in this way up to 120 feet in a foreign body of water. The distance she can travel in her own body of water is limited only by the extent of that body of water. The body of water must be of sufficient size to immerse a Medium or larger creature.

**Aura of Purity.** Once per day, Nesseya can radiate an aura of purifying energy with a 30-foot radius centered on herself. The aura moves with Nesseya and lasts for up to 10 minutes without concentration. Each nonhostile createure in the aura, including Nesseya can't become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause any of the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.

## Nesseya's Lair

Nesseya's lair is located in a bend of the Bainwithy river. It is an idyllic spot with banks lined by rushes shaded by large willows.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing ties) the naiad takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* The naiad creates fog as though she had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round
* The naiad affects the water of her lair as though she had cast the control water spell. The effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.

## Regional Effects

A naiad and her lair are more bound up with each other even more strongly than is the case with dragons and their lairs. The fey magic involved creates one or more of the following effects:

* The banks or borders of the naiad’s lair take on the idyllic character of the fey realm. For example, the banks of a river naiad’s lair might be overhung with beautiful willow trees or the surface of the water of a pool naiad’s lair might be thick with bright water-lillies.
* Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of the naiad’s body of water within 1 mile of the naiad’s lair, the naiad becomes aware of the creature’s presence and location.

**Nesseya** is a **greater naiad**, a primeval being gifted with exceptional powers. She appears as a stunningly-beautiful, slender, copper-haired maiden with pale skin and blushed cheeks. She typically wears a simple, thigh-length smock of sheer, pale-green fabric. Like the Bainwithy River she embodies, she is adaptable, placid and nurturing, but powerful and relentless -- quite literally a force of nature.
