**Shapechanger.** The arachnaed can use its action to polymorph into a form that resembles a female drow or giant spider, or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The arachnaed’s innate spell casting ability is Charisma (Spell save DC 14). The arachnaiad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _druidcraft, web_  
3/day each: _dominate beast (arachnids only), evil eye, spike growth_  

**Magic Resistance.** The arachnaed has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The arachnaed can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Speak with Arachnids.** The arachnaed can communicate with ettercaps, spiders, and other arachnids as if they shared a language.

**Web Walker.** The arachnid ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The arachnaed makes two melee attacks.

**Slam (Bite in Spider Form).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. (10 ft. in true form), one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning (piercing in spider form) damage plus 21 (6d6) poison damage.

**Poison Kiss (Drow Form).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 32 (5d10 + 5) poison damage. The attack automatically hits a creature charmed by the arachnaed. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned unit the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated.

**Whispers of Betrayal.** The arachnaed targets one humanoid or beast within 60 feet of her. If the target can hear the arachnaed, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. If the arachnaed or creatures friendly to it are fighting the target, the target has advantage on the saving throw.  
A charmed creature must use its movement and actions on each of its turns to attack a creature other than itself that the arachnaed mentally choses. The target will use its most effective attacks against the chosen creature, but will not expend charges from magic items or use up other non-replinishable resources. If the chosen creature is not in range, the arachnaed can take total and precise control of the target to move it within range.  
On subsequent turns, the arachnaiad must use her action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Each time the arachnaed or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. The effect lasts for as long as the arachnaed maintains concentration, up to 1 minute. If the target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the arachnid’s _Whispers of Betrayal_ for the next 24 hours.  

**Spore Cloud Form.** The arachnaed transforms into a toxic cloud of spores or reverts to its true form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is also transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
While in spore cloud form, the arachnaed is incapacitated and can’t speak. It has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can pass through any space that isn’t airtight. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to nonmagical damage.
While in spore cloud form, the arachnaed can enter a creature’s space and stop there. Each time that creature starts its turn with the arachnaed in its space, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated.

**Arachnaeds** are dark fey spirits native to the tangled forests of Cymmyrion. They are capable of transforming themselves into the likeness of a female drow, a giant spider, or a toxic cloud of spores. In their true form, they resemble a man-sized plant with long, spine-covered tendrils and a bulbous center stalk crowned with a cluster of blood-red fruits. They are always female and readily cooperate with their sisters, with whom they share a telepathic bond. They can stay motionless in one place indefinitely and can draw nourishment and moisture from the soil. For this reason, they are often employed as guardians.
