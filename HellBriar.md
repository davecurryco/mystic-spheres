# Hell Briar

_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a tendril of briar)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  

Lashing tendrils of sharp-thorned black briar fill a 20-foot radius centered on a point that you an see within range. For the duration, these tendrils turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 3d6 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the tendrils until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tendrils takes 3d6 piercing damage plus an additional 1d6 necrotic damage and 1d6 fire damage.

A creature restrained by the tendrils can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
