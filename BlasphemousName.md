# Blasphemous Name

_5th-level chthonic_  

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You speak the name of an Elder Being -- a name which should not be spoken. Each creature within 10 feet of you that is not an aberration, celestial or fiend and can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

When you cast this spell, you must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or accidentally summon an aberration or fiend of CR 3-5, which will appear on its own initiative in the next round in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. The summoned creature will attempt to sieze you and drag you back to its plane of origin as punishment for your effrontery.
