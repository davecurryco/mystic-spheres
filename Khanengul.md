# Khanengul

Khanengul is the oldest and most powerful of the city-states of Khanashar. It is situated where the Ghalez River flows into Moshul Bay at the southern end of Arestor. It is the center of trade and commerce for the southlands and the fertile soil of the Ghalez Valley supports the largest urban population on the continent.

## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Oligarchy

A titular monarch, the _Shan_, is the official head of state in Khanengul, but the real power lies with the _Amel Merjan_, the Five Merchants, who form his council, the _Darban_. Acting for the state, the council employs the city watch, a professional military, and an elite mercenary guard called the _Torusan_, or Celestial Bulls.

## Religion

**Majority Religion:** Polytheism

The people of Khanengul subscribe to a bewildering variety of beliefs drawn from the many periods of the city's long history and cultures of its diverse population. These range from primitive animism to direct diety-worship to sophisticated philosopical and mystical traditions. Some of these peacefully co-exist and others, to say the least, do not.

## Layout

The main body of the walled city occupies the slopes of a ridge of seven hills that forms a promontory that extends into the Bay of Arkhanen below the west bank of the Ghalez river. A fortress stands on the tip of the promontory to guard the mouth of the river and the harbor to its west. A smaller fortress is situated on the east side of the river.
