**Innate Spellcasting.** The greater lamia’s innate spell casting ability is Charisma (Spell save DC 16). The lamia can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _detect thoughts, clairvoyance, major image, suggestion_  
3/day each: _dominate person, hypnotic pattern, mislead, modify memory, scrying_  
1/day each: _eyebite, geas, seeming_  

**Magic Resistance.** The greater lamia has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Shapechanger.** The greater lamia can use her action to polymorph into a Small or Medium female humanoid she has seen, or back into her true form. Her statistics, other than her size, are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts back to her true form if she dies. In her polymorphed form, the lamia always wears or carries some item made of snakeskin. If she loses possession of this item, she is unable to polymorph again or resume her true form until she recovers it. A creature that has this item in its possession is immune to any of the lamia's spells or spell-like powers.

**Wakeful.** The greater lamia is always awake.

## Actions

**Intoxicating Gaze.** The lamia targets one humanoid that she can see within 60 feet of her. If the target can see the lamia, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the lamia as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the lamia’s control, it takes the lamia’s requests of actions in the most favorable way it can.
Each time the lamia or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the lamia dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or the lamia ends the effect as a bonus action. If the target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the lamia’s Intoxicating Gaze for the next 24 hours.
The lamia can have no more than one humanoid charmed at a time.

**Intoxicating Touch.** _Melee Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ The target is magically cursed for 24 hours. Until the curse ends, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and all ability checks.

## Legendary Actions

**Arcane Boon.** Once per day, a lamia can innately cast an additional spell. The demon lord who is the lamia's patron grants the lamia a single additional spell drawn from the following list: Dream, Magic Jar, Mirage Arcane, Planar Binding, Simulacrum, Word of Recall. The lamia has wide disecretion about which spell she chooses and how she uses it.

**Greater Lamias** were once mortal women, but have been cursed by the gods, usually as punishment for some unspeakable crime against their children. A greater lamia has a beautiful humanoid upper body that merges into the tail of a great serpent with glittering golden scales. Along with this transformation, the transgressor is made immortal and condemned to obsess over her crimes for all eternity. If she closes her eyes, she sees the image of her wrongdoing in all its detail. A greater lamia's very sustainance is a grisly reminder of her misdeeds, for she must feed on humanoid children. It is little wonder then that these miserable creatures are typically consumed by plots of revenge and destruction.
