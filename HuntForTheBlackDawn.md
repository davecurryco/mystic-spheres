# Hunt for the Black Dawn

## Introduction

Koju Kishina, formerly captain of the pirate ship Black Dawn, was murdered by his first mate, Makala-Koho. Due to the influence of a nearby evil artifact, the drowned man came back as a **revenant**. However, Makala now plies the seas as captain of the Black Dawn. To get close enough to exact revenge, Captain Kishina recruits the adventurers. To win their aid, he tells them that if they help him kill Makala, one of them may bear his family sword with honor. This means that the character so chosen may attune to the sword, converting it from a Magic Weapon, +1 to a Sword of Sharpness.

On her last foray to the Keraz Coast, the Black Dawn overhauled a merchant dao carrying a strange cargo -- an idol of mottled green jade in the image of a snake-headed king. In the belief that the idol was valuable, Captain Makala had it stowed aboard his galley before scuttling the merchantman. From that time forward, the Black Dawn suffered a streak of bad luck.

The statue was stolen from an ancient temple in the deep jungles of the Opanala River valley in Ophar. Anyone who possesses it, even briefly, is cursed until the statue is returned to the temple.

The adventurers get news of the Black Dawn from Jhiraz Qian, the galley's former carpenter, who was cast adrift after a dispute with Captain Makala. Jiraz believes that Makala intends to visit a witch who lives in the swamps that lie at the mouth of the Khourhal River on Ykriz Bay.

## Ships

### The Black Dawn

The _Black Dawn_ is a captured and repurposed Red Reaver galley. The ship has fallen on hard times under Captain Makala's poor leadership and the Curse of the Idol. It is in poor repair and down to a minimal crew, most of which are recent "recruits" from vessels the Dawn has taken.

**Captain:** Makala-Koho (M, 35, Aili, pirate captain, NE, Amusement/Condescending/Olive)  
_Maka is dark-skinned even for an Aili. He is intelligent and easily bored, which led him to a life of adventure on the seas. He slakes his thirst for excitement with mayhem in combat and acts of torture and rape afterward. Without Captain Kishina's restraining hand, there is little to stop him from slaughtering everyone aboard a captured vessel these days. On shore leave, he is the type to pick a fight that results in the burning of a tavern, or an entire village. The hands aboard the ship regard Maka with a mixture of awe and fear._

**First Mate:** Jenlang Kwo (M, 21, Juchin, ship captain, N, Recognition/Bitter/Brown-eyed) 
_Jenlang took ship with Kishina in the hope of an opportunity to become known as an explorer, a charter of the uncharted. He was navigator under Captain Kishina, but he is currently first mate under Captain Makala, with whom he shares a tendency to bloodlust. Jenlang has a deep resentment of the money-grubbing merchants who were his previous employers. If it were up to him, no merchantman would come off an encounter with The Black Dawn without being burned down to the waterline. His light brown eyes are unusual for a Juchin. The suggestion that he is of mixed ancestry makes Jenlan feel even more an outcast. He is easily slighted, but as he is a man of no great courage, he wreaks revenge in backdoor ways._  

**Bosun:** Kaheera Zhulha (M, 31, Kwanshali, pirate veteran, LN, Revenge/Sincere/Pimply)  
_Formerly chief gunner, Kaheera has been promoted to bosun. He still thirsts for revenge against the slavers who destroyed his village and took him captive in his youth. His face is deeply pockmarked from a disease he contracted aboard the slave vessel and his back is scarred from the lash. He is blunt, callous, and ruthless, but he always says what he means and does what he says._

**Marine Sergeant:** Obea Nghuwa (M, 25, Kwanshali, gladiator, N, Acceptance/Offensive/Strong)  
_Obea was captured by slavers before he was old enough to undergo his rite of passage. Although he is now an accomplished fighter, having been trained as a gladiator, he is secretly ashamed at his lack of the ritual scars that mark warriors in his tribe. In compensation, Obea constantly seeks to prove himself to his companions. He lusts for combat and when no prey is at hand he readily takes and gives offense in order to goad others into a fight. Obea strikes an imposing figure so he gets few takers, but almost all of the crew resent him._  

**Galley (Bireme)**

**Cargo:** 2 tons 
**Crew:** 62 crew (rabble) / 12 officers  

**Weapons:** 3 ballista (shot, chain) port & starboard / 1 ballista fore & aft / 0 amidships  

## Adventure Hooks

### The Pirate's Tale

**Ship's Carpenter:** Jhiraz Qian (Pirate, Juchin) (Fear/Sarcastic/Frail)  
_Jhiraz was a passenger aboard a vessel that was captured by pirates. The pirates eagerly pressed him into service and the thoroughly cowed Jhiraz readily took the oath. He is terrified by the sea and is constantly busy to make the ship as seaworthy and combat-ready as possible as a mather of self-preservation. As a result of the stress and overwork, he is in poor health and ill spirits. He coughs constantly between caustic comments about anything and everything._

Jiraz can be found at an opium den in Khanengul called _The Four Petals of Paradise_. When lucid enough to speak, but drugged enough to bear the memory, he can tell of his misfortunes aboard The Black Pearl and of his escape in a raft made of barrels he had carefully waterproofed.

## Swamp of the Bog Witch

_Map:_ [Swamp of the Bog Witch](SwampOfTheBogWitch.pdf)

The Opanala River drains into Yrkiz Bay by means of a hundred channels that wind through a delta. Near the head of the delta, a tributary stream runs past a fetid swamp of rush-choked marshes, moss-grown cypress and mangroves, treacherous quicksands, and scum-covered ponds. Narrow, twisting waterways thread through the bog.

At the rotten heart of the swamp is the lair of the Bog Witch, whose domain this is.

### A) Stockade Ruins

The ruins of a stone-and-timber slaver's stockade stand atop a bluff overlooking the river just before the entrance channel to the swamp. Although the stockade was destroyed only last year, the timbers of its watchtower still stand high enough to be useful as a landmark.

Blackened skulls and bones in the cinders of the stone-ringed fire-pit at the center of the stockade's courtyard provide a clue as to the fate of the garrison. Nothing of value remains here. Every piece of metal, even nails and staples, has been removed. A few of the buildings, particularly the watchtower, had stone foundations, but otherwise only charred posts and timbers remain.

The local Quetalpa tribesmen who destroyed the stockade keep an intermittent watch on the river from the vantage of the bluff. During the day, there is a 50% chance that 1d6 **tribal warriors** will be on the site. If the watchers spy intruders, they will attempt to keep them under observation without being observed themselves. Thier superior woodcraft gives them advantage on Dexterity(Stealth) checks made while in natural cover. If the adventurers camp in the area after slaying any of the watchers, they will be attacked at night by a raiding party of 20 **tribal warriors** led by two **berserkers** and a **chieftain**. The tribesmen will not enter into the swamp itself for any reason.

Soon after taking one of the channels into the swamp, the adventurers will see a small creature swimming toward their craft. As it draws near, they will see that it is a **raccoon** (same stats as a giant rat). If it gets close enough, the raccoon will attempt to clamber aboard. The creature is rabid and might infect someone it bites. 

### B) Hippo Wallows

During the day, 4d6 hippopotamus lie half-submerged along the banks of the channel in these spots. At least one is always an alpha bull, which will very likely attack any craft the size of a launch or smaller.

### C) Fog Bank

A foul, stinking fog lingers here in all but the windiest weather. This reduces visibility to a mere 10 feet. Hidden stumps in the shallow waters of the channel pose a navigation hazard for vessels that are not guided by someone intimately familar with the waters. Since the main channel bears right, it is also likely that an unguided vessel will miss the side channel that leads more directly to the bog witch's lair.

The bog witch often posts a lookout here. During the day, her pet buzzard is 70% likely to be perched in a tree above the fog. If the bird hears the approach of intruders, it will fly directly to the witch's lair to give warning, emitting a series of harsh croaks as it flies.

### D) The Gauntlet

The channel narrows here and the trees overhang it on both sides. The bog witch assumes that anyone who gets side-tracked into this area is an intruder so she has awakened many of the trees here. For each half-hour of travel here, intruders are 80% likely to be attacked by 1d4 **awakened trees**.

### E) Temple Ruins

Enormous blocks of greenish stone covered with vines and overgrown with cypress trees jut up from the southeast bank of the channel. Some of these are carved in intricate motifs almost completely effaced by moss and weather.

There is nothing to explore here as any chambers or passages in the buildings fell to into ruin centuries ago. However, the ruins are the haunt of a band of **carnivorous apes**. A band of 8 of them will attack any creatures lingering in this area for more than 10 minutes.

### F) Jaws

This small, shallow lake is relatively deep, although the water is murky. The marshy area on the northeast is roost to a large number of ill-tempered black swans that hiss and threaten any creature that comes too close. The lake and surrounding shores are the territory of a **giant crocodiles**. The beast lurks mostly submerged near the western shore. It will attempt to capsize any vessels that come near and eat anything that falls out. It has advantage on Dexterity(Stealth) checks made to surprise, although its attack will be presaged when the nearby swans suddenly take wing.

The crocodile lairs beneath a huge half-submerged cypress trunk at the south end of the lake. It will drag its victims there, as it prefers to let them rot for a few days before it eats them. It will also retreat there if its attack is beaten off. Odd bones and items from the crocodile's previous kills lie in the muck beneath 5 feet of murky water, where a diver might find them -- with considerable effort.

**Treasure:** 40 gp, 12 pp; Ring of Water Walking

**Junk:** Rusty shortsword; Ruined leather belt with tarnished bronze buckle and studs; 3 x flint javelin-heads;

### G) Fire Fen

The ground here is spongy and the air smells strongly of sulfur. For each 10 minutes the party spends walking here there is a 25% chance that one of the party (determined randomly) will trigger an explosive gout of flame 10 feet high and 5 feet in diameter. Each creature in the area of the flame must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 3d6 + 3 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

In the center of the fen, a jagged monolith of mottled red stone leans crookedly. The stone is strangely free of moss and lichen and is unnaturally warm to the touch. Its uppermost edge is carved with a curious series of horizontal and diagonal notches. If a creature runs its finger along the notches, a **fire elemental** will appear at a random location 5-30 feet away and will immediately attack.

### H) Lair O' the Glare

The north end of this weed-grown, muddy shallow has been sectioned off with a loose stake-and-wattle fence. In the center of the fence, a single gate rises between thick timber posts driven deep in the mud and adorned with hanging clusters of weathered human skulls. Within the fence, the swamp-water is fetid and clotted with algae. The water near the bank is thick with high rushes, amid which a **catoblepas** cow ranges.

The bog hag keeps the catoblepas for its rancid milk, which she drinks and makes into a virulently malodorous cheese. The fence is intended to keep the bog hag's minions out, rather than to keep the catoblepas in. The rushes give the monstrosity advantage on Dexterity(Stealth) checks, although any creature with a working nose will be able to smell it before seeing it.

The catoblepas will bellow as it attacks. This will draw a random encounter 1d10 turns after the combat ends.

### I) Island of Snares

This small island is infested with scores of **giant spiders**, which have filled the spaces between the trees with their webs. They are semi-intelligent: INT 6 (-2), but cannot swim so they are trapped on the island. The bog hag planted the spiders here and she occasionally sends them prisoners to supplement their diet of birds, lizards, snakes, and unwary tribesmen. The spiders believe the bog hag to be a goddess and eagerly obey her commands.

### J) Lake of the Clan

If the adventurers have raised the alarm, they will be set on by 4 war canoes, each manned by 6 **tribal warriors**. Otherwise, during the day there will be 1d6 log canoes each with 1d4 **tribesmen** out on the water, fishing for their sustanence.

Along the northeast bank of the lake, a beehive-shaped hut on stilts juts precariously out of the rushes. A sunken, moss-grown canoe is tied up to a rickety pier made of driftwood lashed together with bark rope. A wisened tribesman sits quietly in the open door of the hut. He appears to be meditating, but is actually tending a fishing line.

**Witch Doctor:** Tlaqui (M, 73, Quetalpa, shaman, N, Greed, Bitter, Unkempt)

Tlaqui was once held in awe by the tribesmen, but the bog witch played on his avarice and stole his spirit-stick, which she tauntingly planted in the middle of the Island of Snares. Without his focus, Tlaqui cannot cast spells and bears the full burden of his advanced years. He knows that he could not survive an attempt to recover his spirit-stick and has resigned himself to living out the remainder of his days in bitterness and melancholy trapped in his hut on the lake.

### K) Tribal Village

Approximately 80 tribal Quetalpa live in crude conical huts on this, the largest area of relatively dry land in the whole swamp. The bog witch has drugged their well, which provides the only potable water for miles around. The villagers are completely under the witch's mind control. Their gaze is glassy and vacant and they behave like zombies, although they move much faster.

## The Cypress Tower

_Map:_ [Cypress Tower](CypressTower.pdf)

A collosal cypress tree rises above the surrounding swamp. The approaches are guarded by the bog witch's minions and her familiar, an **imp**, watches invisibly from the great tree's branches.

### A) Swamp Water

The murky swamp water surrounding the cypress tower is patrolled by five **bog wights**. A wight lurks beneath the surface at each of the channels on the approach to the cypress and another haunts the tangled weeds surrounding a half-submerged fallen tree-trunk in the northeast corner of the area. The wights will ambush intruders who come within range of their tremorsense. Once one wight has engaged, the others will swim beneath the surface to join in on the attack.

### B) Waterside Pier

A ship's longboat is tied up on the south side of the pier. The _Black Dawn_ is tied up on the north side, mast unshipped and oars stowed. It is unmanned, as the pirates are all either in the bunk house or the cypress tower. The idol, wrapped in a piece of sailcloth tied up with rope, lies on the deck waiting for Captain Makala to call for it.

**Treasure:** Jade idol (7,500 GP) _A statue four feet high carved of a single piece of exquisite mottled jade in the image of a snake-headed king wearing a feathered kilt and adorned with feathered ornaments. The idol is cursed. Any creature who possesses it, even briefly, will suffer disadvantage on encounter rolls until it is returned to the temple from which it was stolen. The statue weighs 500 lbs., which is light for its size due to the design being pierced and hollowed in many places with considerably mastery and artistry._

The captain's cabin of the galley is untidy in the extreme. Various items typical to a pirate captain's life are strewn about over the chair and table. There is a hidden compartment under the bunk -- Perception(Wisdom) DC 15 to decect it. Inside is an iron strongbox locked with a padlock -- DC 15 with thieve's tools to open it. The chest is filled with coins and gems. Beneath them, the chest has a false bottom -- Perception(Wisdom) DC 15 to find it.

**Goods:** Traveler's clothes; 1 bottle Fortified Wine (Good); 3 Daggers;

**Treasure (strongbox):** 500 cp, 9000 sp, 220 gp, 14 pp, Bloodstone (50 gp), 2 x Citrine (50 gp), Jasper (50 gp), Moonstone (50 gp), Onyx (50 gp), 4 x Sardonyx (50 gp), Star rose quartz (50 gp);

**Treasure (strongbox false bottom):** Map: _A piece of parchment on which is a roughly-drawn map showing several square buildings and a large, withered tree. Writing in Kwanshali points out the tree and gives a set of directions from it to a designated spot a little distance away._

The forward hold contains high-end goods taken from merchant ships:

**Goods:** Pseudodragon in an iron cage; 2 x cask Rum; 5 x Bell (bronze, small); 2 x Robe (priest of Gilgesh, ancient); 3 x Thurible (Shaira)

**Treasure:** Sovereign Glue

The midship hold contains ballast and regular goods taken from merchant ships:

**Goods:** 3 x crates Tea, black; 4 x Smith's tools; Wig; 20 lbs. Spices (pepper); 3 lbs. Saffron; 15 x Clothes, fine

**Treasure:** Gloves of Thievery

The pier is lit at intervals by tiki-torches that burn with a sooty flame that casts an unwholesome, flickering light and gives off an odor of pitch and sulphur.

### C) Bunkhouse

A dilapidated shack with a palm-thatched roof at the end of the pier provides temporary housing for visitors of the bog witch. It has no doors and its furnishings consist solely of a rickety table and a rusted iron stove. Ten **pirates** and two **swashbucklers** are bunked here on heaps of furs and scraps of sailcloth. The bosun and marine sergeant of the _Black Dawn_ play dice together crouched at the far end of the one-room building. The pirates have built a smoky fire in the stove in an attempt to keep off the flies and mosquitoes. The smoke lingers beneath the ceiling, so it is difficult to see or breathe freely if one is standing.

### D) Upper Deck

The first mate of the _Black Dawn_, Kaheera Zhulha, stands guard on the upper deck of the pier where the drawbriege to the cypress tower connects.

Like the waterside pier, the deck is lit with torches, but the heads of these are small humanoid skulls -- each of which holds a pool of oil in which a wick burns with a greasy, black smoke.

### E) Cypress Tower

An enormous, ancient cypress tree stands in the midst of the islet. The trunk divides about 10 feet above the roots and the smaller section to the south still thrives. The larger section to the north is hollow, although some living branches are left. A gateway has been hewn on the north side of the tree and is covered with a drawbridge that connects to the upper deck of the pier.

Inside the hollow, a floor has been built up with packed earth covered in filthy mats woven of rushes. The embers of a fire-pit lined with stones lend a constant dim illumination to the room -- a backdrop to the flashes of green and purple that burst at intervals through the door-curtain to the bog witch's chamber. The walls are hung with the skins of various small creatures stretched on drying-racks made of willow branches. Most of the pelts are those of muskrats, weasels, and voles, but there are also two python skins and the back-skin of a goblin.

A rusty, but sturdy iron cage stands in the corner of the room. Inside the cage a Kwanshali **cultist**, a girl of some 13 years of age named Kalya, crouches in the corner with her head bowed to her knees in despair. Her hair is straight as is typical of aristocrats of her people, but she is naked except for a loincloth twisted from scraps of finery.

Captain Makala sits half-sprawled on the steps to the Conjuration Platform with a crystal goblet of fortified wine at his elbow. He leers at the girl in the cage and idly twists the point of a wicked-looking dagger into the wooden step nearest to hand. However, although he has cruelly abused her already, the girl is not here for Maka's delictation. She is a slave, captured from a Kwanshali vessel off the coast of Hannesh, that he has tendered to the bog witch in consideration of her services.

### F) Conjuration Platform

A raised tier reached by wooden steps rises 5 feet above the lower floor. It is bordered by a railing made of twisted driftwood and bones, lashed together by hemp twine and rawhide thongs. Clusters of shrunken heads, eyes and lips sewn shut with sinew, hang by their long hair from the railing.

The floor of this tier was wood leveled with adzes and has been incised with a large conjuration circle inlaid in silver. A table of carved ebony decorated with gold leaf stands along the west wall. The table could adorn an emperor's palace were it not battered, scratched, and stained with long years of abuse. Instead, it holds a pair of gold-plated, enameled candlesticks, in which greenish-black candles sputter with a smokey, yellowish flame. A tome of eldrich lore lies open between the candlesticks, atop an incongrously-dainty doily of fine lace.  

**Treasure:** The Fiendish Fragments of Thatelch: _This ancient tome is written in blood upon goblin-skin parchment and bound in hide-covered iron plates which are locked with an iron lock. Whenever it is opened, divination spells affecting the reader cease functioning._

### G) Bog Witch's Chamber

This chamber is hewn from the living wood of a bole of the cypress tree. A hemp net woven with random scraps of cloth, bones, shells, and other trinkets is stretched across the door as a curtain. Noiseome pelts piled atop layers of moss and swamp-rushes serve the witch for a bed and a small fire-pit smokes faintly near it. Along the wall opposite the fire-pit, a large hide-covered sea-chest with tarnished bronze fittings holds the witch's most prized possessions. The rest of the room is strewn and cluttered with her less-prized possessions, which are many and of mind-boggling variety:

**Junk:** Glass jar (cracked); Boot; Javelin head (bronze, corroded); Handkerchief (lace, stained with blood); Crock catching dripping sap from ceiling; Ripped backpack; Club (broken); Helm (iron, badly dented); Cord (ball 30 ft.); Brush (wooden with boar's hair bristles); 

**Goods:** Elaborate carved and gilded mahogany headboard (250 GP); Tailor's tools (in wicker basket); 5 x Clothes, aristocratic (dirty and torn, out of fashion, 10 GP each if repaired); Mummified manticore foot (10 GP); Mug (brass with gold filigree, 20 GP); Ivory cameo on a broken pearl necklace (25 GP); Glass beaker containing the mummified body of a female pixie (15 GP); Pendant (brass, badly corroded, concentric circle motif, 5 GP)

The Bog Witch, a **green hag**, squats in the center of the room before a curiously-ornate bronze brazier surrounded by a clutter of fine porcelain dishes, clay pots, glass jars, and woven-grass baskets -- all filled with powders, granules, and fibers of various unidentifiable sorts. Safe in her lair and preoccupied with other matters, the hag is undisguised. She mutters in a low voice and taps rhythmically on a set of tom-toms made from two skulls, one ogre-sized and one human-sized, stretched with the hide of some unwholesome creature. The brazier smokes with a chemical stench and flickers with a sickly yellowish flame that casts the hag's hideous features in an even more unflattering light. From time to time, she scoops a handful from one of the containers at her feet and casts it on the fire, causing it to flare brightly with flames of green or purple hue.

The bog witch is engaged in a ritual to summon the spirit of a long-dead priestess of a snake-cult in order to learn the nature of the curse affecting the _Black Dawn_, as Captain Makala has paid her to do. Already, the **ghost** is visible among the noxious vapors that rise from the brazier. If the witch loses concentration, she will lose control of the spirit, which will then attempt to _possess_ a random target (unlikely to be the witch herself since she is protected by the equivalent of a _protection from evil and good_). If she is surprised or significantly damaged, the hag will cast a handful of powder on the flames and use the bright flash this produces as cover to cast _invisibility_ and move off a short distance.

The witch carries a bundle of keys at her belt, but no treasure. She does have a leopard-skin case that contains a blowgun, a case of blowgun darts, and a vial of poison handy at the foot of the bed. If she has time, she will arm herself with these before confronting intruders. This will give her the following additional attack option:

 **Blowgun.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 25/100 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 1 piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Poisoned creatures are paralyzed for 3 rounds, beginning at the start of the witch's next turn, and have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws while poisoned in this way.

 The witch might also avail herself of the items in her sea-chest depending on the tactical situation.

The witch's sea-chest is bound with a **chain of binding**, which appears as a rusty iron chain locked with padlocks. This animated object will attack anyone who attempts to open the chest.

The chest is locked with three locks, each of which can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieve's tools. The keys are among those that the witch carries. The chest is also trapped:

**Contact Poison Trap**
_Mechanical Trap_
Unless the three locks are unlocked in a certain order (2-3-1) before the chest is opened, a mechanism inside the lid of the trunk will release a potent contact poison inside the chest. A living creature that touches any of the contents of the chest with exposed skin for 1 hour afterward must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. After 1 hour, the saving throw is made at advantage and after 2 hours, the poison loses its potency entirely. A poisoned creature behaves as though affected by a _confusion_ spell for 1 hour, beginning on the creature's next turn, and has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks and saving throws while poisoned in this way. A successful DC 20 Wisdom(Perception) check will reveal that the locks have some additional mechanism, but the nature of the trap cannot be determined from the outside of the chest.

Inside the chest is the witch's treasure hoard:

**Treasure (sea-chest):** 1000 cp, 2600 sp, 590 gp, 100 pp, Silver Figurine (of a Female Elf, heavily tarnished) (250 gp), Leopard Fur Boots stiched with with copper thread (150 gp), Glass Eye (25 gp), Small Tapestry (25 gp), Sable Ribbon set with Carnelian (125 gp), Chrysoprase Necklace (200 gp), +2 Ammunition (50 blowgun needles) (rare, dmg 150), Bead of Force (rare, dmg 154), Oil of Etherealness (rare, dmg 183), Potion of Superior Healing (rare, dmg 187);
