# Hunt for the Black Dawn

## Introduction

Koju Kishina, formerly captain of the pirate ship Black Dawn, was murdered by his first mate, Makala-Koho. Due to the influence of a nearby evil artifact, the drowned man came back as a **revenant**. However, Makala now plies the seas as captain of the Black Dawn. To get close enough to exact revenge, Captain Kishina recruits the adventurers. To win their aid, he tells them that if they help him kill Makala, one of them may bear his family sword with honor. This means that the character so chosen may attune to the sword, converting it from a Magic Weapon, +1 to a Sword of Sharpness.

On her last foray to the Keraz Coast, the Black Dawn overhauled a merchant dao carrying a strange cargo -- an idol carved in green jade in the image of a snake-headed king wearing a feathered kilt and adorned with feathered ornaments. In the belief that the idol was valuable, Captain Makala had it stowed aboard his galley before scuttling the merchantman. From that time forward, the Black Dawn suffered a streak of bad luck.

The statue was stolen from an ancient temple in the deep jungles of the Opanala River valley in Ophar. Anyone who possesses it, even briefly, is cursed until the statue is returned to the temple.

The adventurers get news of the Black Dawn from Jhiraz Qian, the galley's former carpenter, who was cast adrift after a dispute with Captain Makala. Jiraz believes that Makala intends to visit a witch who lives in the swamps of Ykriz Bay.

## Ships

### The Black Dawn

**Captain:** Makala-Koho (Pirate Veteran, Aili) (Amusement/Condescending/Olive)  
_Maka is dark-skinned even for an Aili. He is intelligent and easily bored, which led him to a life of adventure on the seas. He slakes his thirst for excitement with mayhem in combat and acts of torture and rape afterward. Without Captain Kishina's restraining hand, there is little to stop him from slaughtering everyone aboard a captured vessel these days. On shore leave, he is the type to pick a fight that results in the burning of a tavern, or an entire village. The hands aboard the ship regard Maka with a mixture of awe and fear._

**Galley (Bireme)**

**Cargo:** 2 tons and 22 marines  
**Crew:** 62 crew (rabble) / 12 officers  

**Weapons:** 3 ballista (shot, chain) port & starboard / 1 ballista fore & aft / 0 amidships  

## Adventure Hooks

### The Pirate's Tale

**Ship's Carpenter:** Jhiraz Qian (Pirate, Juchin) (Fear/Sarcastic/Frail)  
_Jhiraz was a passenger aboard a vessel that was captured by pirates. The pirates eagerly pressed him into service and the thoroughly cowed Jhiraz readily took the oath. He is terrified by the sea and is constantly busy to make the ship as seaworthy and combat-ready as possible as a mather of self-preservation. As a result of the stress and overwork, he is in poor health and ill spirits. He coughs constantly between caustic comments about anything and everything._

Jiraz can be found at an opium den in Khanengul called _The Four Petals of Paradise_. When lucid enough to speak, but drugged enough to bear the memory, he can tell of his misfortunes aboard The Black Pearl and of his escape in a raft made of barrels he had carefully waterproofed.
