## Actions

**Reverent Awe.** The mummified monk targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummified monk, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become paralyzed until the end of the mummified monk's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also deafened and blinded for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the _Reverent Awe_ of all mummified monks for the next 24 hours.

## Legendary Actions

**Bestow a Boon.** Once per month as an action, a mummified monk can innately cast an additional spell, which can only target another creature or group of creatures. The mummified monk's accumulated karma grants it a single additional spell drawn from the following list: Geas, Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds, Raise Dead. The spell is invariably related to the mummified monk's spiritual path and a the mummified monk unfailingly acts according to the dictates of this path.

**Mummified Monks** are holy men who have voluntarily undergone a regimen of asceticism, rituals, and a diet of salt, pine bark, and tea made from the sap of the lacquer tree that results in their self-mummification while alive and, thus, a sort of immortality. Despite their appearance, mummified monks are not undead. The ritual involves radiant energy, rather than necrotic energy, and the monk has not truly died, but has entered another plane of consciousness.
