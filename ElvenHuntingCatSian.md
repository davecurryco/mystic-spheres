**Elven Hunting Cats**, _sian_ in elvish, are bred and trained to assist their masters to patrol the borders of their sylvan homelands. They are only slightly smaller than tigers, but their coats are tan rather than orange, with a cream underbelly and dark brown stripes along the back. Sianii, as the elves call them, can be trained to follow a scent as hounds do, although they are more commonly employed to hunt orcs or goblins than game. A sian's size and intelligence makes it more than a match for a worg, but it can climb almost as well as a panther. It is typical for several of these ferocious animals to spring from hiding to take down scouts or watchmen in the first moments of an elven ambush.
