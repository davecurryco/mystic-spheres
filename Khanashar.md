# Khanashar

## Geography

Khanashar spans five distinct geographic regions, the dense forest of Lahmeer to the east, the plains of Ashram, the Ghalez river valley, the low steppes of the Golden Hills, and the Hormez coast.

## Ethnography

The majority of the population of Khanashar are _Khemez_, who are the original inhabitants of the Ghalez River valley from the days of the Old Kingdom. 

Juchin nomads conquered and ruled Khanashar as a vassal-state of the Azruun Empire until its fall. The Juchin held absolute power over the Khemez for a few centuries afterward, but their grip eventally softened. A sizable, but dwindling number of Juchin live according to their traditional ways in the Golden Hills. However, most dwell in the capital Khanengul and in the coastal towns and cities, where they dominate the government, merchant, and tradesman classes. This gives the Juchin influence greater than their share of the population of the capital would suggest. Even the current Shan, Timuraz, is of a Juchin dynasty.
