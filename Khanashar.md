# Khanashar

## Geography

Khanashar spans five distinct geographic regions, the dense forest of Lahmeer to the east, the plains of Ashram, the Ghalez river valley, the low steppes of the Golden Hills, and the Hormez coast.

## Ethnography

The majority of the population of Khanashar are humans of an ethnic group called the _Khemez_. They thickly populate the Ghalez river valley and Plain of Ashram. The Khemez are swarthy, with wavy black hair and dark eyes. The men are often scrawny, with thick, curly beards, while the women tend to be voluptuous, if not corpulent. The Khemez people, especially the peasant farmers and rivermen along the Ghalez, are given to bovine complacency and spiritual fatalism.

The Azruun conquered Khanashar with the aid of tribes of horse nomads from the Golden Hills, west of the Ghalez. The nomads, termed _Juchin_, ruled Khanashar as a vassal-state of the Azruun Empire until its fall. The Juchin held absolute power over the Khemez for a few centuries afterward, but their grip eventally softened. A sizable, but dwindling number of Juchin live according to their traditional ways in the Golden Hills. However, most dwell in the capital Khanengul and in the coastal towns and cities, where they dominate the government, merchant, and tradesman classes. This gives the Juchin influence greater than their share of the population of the capital would suggest. Even the current Shan, Timuraz, is of a Juchin dynasty.
