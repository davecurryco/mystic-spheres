# The Ruins of Lahoor

A 5e adventure for 3-4 7th level characters.

## Background

Lahoor was once a mighty city of the Indhrus civilization. It is now a jungle-overgrown ruin amid the swampy estuary of the Opalana River. The ruins are held to be cursed and are shunned by the Quetalpa tribesmen and the Kheraz coast pirates alike. Recently, however, a band of sahuagin have established a lair among the half-sunken ruins as a staging area for raids against the coastal tribes. The sea devils seek human captives and pearls as offerings for a dragon turtle that demands tribute from their underwater city. Of course, if the monster's greed goes unsatisfied, it might start attacking the pirate and smuggler ships that ply the waters of Ykriz Bay.
