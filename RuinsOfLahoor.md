# The Ruins of Lahoor

A 5e adventure for 3-4 7th level characters.

## Background

Lahoor was once a mighty city of the Indhrus civilization. It is now a jungle-overgrown ruin amid the swampy estuary of the Opalana River. The ruins are held to be cursed and are shunned by the Quetalpa tribesmen and the Kheraz coast pirates alike. Recently, however, a band of sahuagin have established a lair among the half-sunken ruins as a staging area for raids against the coastal tribes. The sea devils seek human captives and pearls as offerings for a dragon turtle that demands tribute from their underwater city. Of course, if the monster's greed goes unsatisfied, it might start attacking the pirate and smuggler ships that ply the waters of Ykriz Bay.

## The Bay

### Encounters

#### The Captives

Close to the coast of the bay, the adventurers spot a native outrigger canoe crammed with 20 Quetalpa men, women, and children -- all wearing wooden slave-collars and crouched dejectedly in the hull. The canoe has no sails and no one is rowing, but it nevertheless moves along on a southwest course toward the Opanala estuary.

The canoe is actually being towed by four **hunter sharks** under the control of 12 **sahaugin**. Four more **hunter sharks** escort the raiders. The Quetalpa are captives taken in a raid on a coastal village two days before. The prisoners have given themselves up for lost and fatalistically await the grim fate they know lies before them.

Occasionally, the fin of a shark breaks the surface or a sahaugin pops its head up to look around. If they are overmatched, the sahuagin will strike for the shoreline with their captives, hoping to make it to a shoal or inlet too shallow for a larger ship to follow. 

## The City Ruins

_Map:_ [Lahoor Map](LahoorMap.jpg)

Except for the Citadel, the city is overgrown with jungle. The districts on the west bank of the river are mostly flooded, with those west of the wall being covered by mangrove swamp.

The walls and square towers of the city were built with laterite blocks surfaced with sandstone quarried from the mountains to the north and floated down the river by barge. Towers and other structures are of sandstone blocks laid with skill and often ornamented with carvings. The architecture is distinguished by the redented, ogival outline of the tower roofs, columned galleries, and corbeled arches over windows and doorways. This style leaves plenty of projecting corners and niches, which are filled with statues representing humans, gods, and demons.

### Districts

#### A) North Commoners

This area is covered in mangrove swamp. The buildings here were mostly wood and stucco and have long rotted away. Only the stone-paved roads are more-or-less visable as channels between the tangled trunks roofed by mangrove canopy. Only canoes and boats of less than 2' draft can hope to make way here.

#### B) South Commoners

Much the same as the North Commoners district, except that the ground is higher toward the south.

#### C) Mercantile

This area is flooded along the banks of the river and its tributary. The buildings here were mostly built of brick or laterite blocks and their walls stand here and there above the weed-choked waters. Nearer the walls, vine-grown, roofless buildings stand under the canopy of the trees. The bridge was built of large blocks of sandstone. Its central piers have collapsed and the rubble between them is a hazard to navigation. 

#### D) Warehouse

Much the same as the mercantile district, except that the buildings were larger and mostly constructed of wood and stucco, so fewer walls remain.

#### E) Artisans

This district is mostly above water except along the banks of the tributary. The buildings here were built of wood and stucco, so only raised mounds remains.

#### F) Scribes

This area is flooded along the banks of the river and its tributary. The buildings here were mostly built of brick or laterite blocks and their walls stand here and there above the weed-choked waters. The bridge was built of large blocks of sandstone. Its central piers have collapsed and the rubble between them is a hazard to navigation.

#### G) Temples

This district is entirely above water and overgrown with trees. The buildings, especially the temples, were built with sandstone blocks on a base of laterite.

#### H) Tradesmen

This area is flooded along the banks of the river and its tributary. The buildings here were mostly built of brick or laterite blocks and their walls stand here and there above the weed-choked waters. The bridge was built of large blocks of sandstone. Its central piers have collapsed and the rubble between them is a hazard to navigation.

#### I) Entertainment

The bank of the river in this area was shored up with stone. The piers are long since rotted away, but their stone abutments still project into the water at intervals along the bank.

The South Gate is particularly well preserved. Although it is overgrown with moss and creepers, its arch is intact and its bas-relief carvings are still plainly visible.

#### J) Nobles

The bank of the river in this area was shored up with stone. The piers are long since rotted away, but their stone abutments still project into the water at intervals along the bank. This district is entirely above water and the trees are more sparse here than elsewhere. The buildings, especially those of the palace, were built with sandstone blocks on a base of laterite. The streets were made of well-laid blocks of stone and are still plainly visibile, although much cracked and heaved by the roots of the trees.

#### K) Wealthy

This district is entirely above water, although it is overgrown with jungle. The buildings were built with sandstone blocks on a base of laterite. The streets were made of well-laid blocks of stone and are still plainly visibile, although much cracked and heaved by the roots of the trees.

#### L) Clergy

In this district, the jungle has grown over the rubble of the walls and is thicker than elsewhere. The buildings were built with blocks of laterite, with columns and bases of sandstone.

#### M) Officials

The stone shorings along the bank of the river in this area were undermined by the river. The tumbled stone is a hazard to any vessel attempting to land here. The buildings were built with blocks of laterite, with columns and bases of sandstone. 

#### N) Citadel

The Citadel occupies a bluff that rises 50 feet above the level of the river. The outer walls were strongly-built of large sandstone blocks facing a core of rubble bound with cement. The fortress was likewise built with blocks of sandstone with stone towers at the corners. The ground is drier here than anywhere else in the city and only a few small trees and bushes grow up among the stone-flagged streets.

#### O) Military

This area is above water, except for a few places along the riverbank where the stone shorings collapsed. The jungle is thick here, but the streets are still visible as trails among the trees.

#### P) East Commoners

This area is overgrown by thick, almost impassable jungle. The buildings here were mostly wood and stucco and have long rotted away. Only the stone-paved roads are more-or-less visible as trails among the trees.

### Buildings

#### 1) Market Hall

#### 2) University

The rectangular roofs of several sandstone buildings are visible above the river water.  

#### 3) Temple of the Old God

#### 4) Temple of the Snake God

#### 5) Ampitheater

#### 6) Great Bridge

#### 7) Tower of the Sorcerer

#### 8) Palace

#### 9) Abbey

#### 10) Barracks

#### 11) Shipyards

Near the stone piers along the riverbank are several large buildings sturdily built of sandstone with stone-tiled roofs that are leaky, but intact. These buildings were used to build and refit ships, but they are now surrounded by a post-and-wattle wall eight feet high so as to form a barracoon to hold the eighty **commoner** captives the sahuagin have taken. The same post-and-wattle construction has been used to block up the wide doors of some of the larger buildings which were used in shipbuilding. Twenty **sahuagin** guard the grounds to prevent the escape of any captives.

If rescued, the Quetalpa tribesfolk can tell the party that they were taken in raids of several coastal villages over the past week. Some of the captives will also offer that the sahuagin also took quantities of pearls produced by divers of their villages.

#### 12) Observatory

The observatory is a two-story rectangular building from which a four-story round tower protrudes. The tower has a dome made of stone, which is intact. An oculus at the apex of the tower lets light into the interior, illuminating the stone stairs that wind around the inside. The upper floors were constructed of wood planks supported by wooden beams, but only the corbels on which the timbers were once set remain. This provides an ideal shelter for birds. River swallows roost in the building by the hundreds.
