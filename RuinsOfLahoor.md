# The Ruins of Lahoor

A 5e adventure for 3-4 7th level characters.

## Background

Lahoor was once a mighty city of the Indhrus civilization. It is now a jungle-overgrown ruin amid the swampy estuary of the Opalana River. The ruins are held to be cursed and are shunned by the Quetalpa tribesmen and the Kheraz coast pirates alike. Recently, however, a band of sahuagin have established a lair among the half-sunken ruins as a staging area for raids against the coastal tribes. The sea devils seek human captives and pearls as offerings for a dragon turtle that demands tribute from their underwater city. Of course, if the monster's greed goes unsatisfied, it might start attacking the pirate and smuggler ships that ply the waters of Ykriz Bay.

## The Bay

### Encounters

#### The Captives

Close to the coast of the bay, the adventurers spot a native outrigger canoe crammed with 20 Quetalpa men, women, and children -- all wearing wooden slave-collars and crouched dejectedly in the hull. The canoe has no sails and no one is rowing, but it nevertheless moves along on a southwest course toward the Opanala estuary.

The canoe is actually being towed by four **hunter sharks** under the control of 12 **sahaugin**. Four more **hunter sharks** escort the raiders. The Quetalpa are captives taken in a raid on a coastal village two days before. The prisoners have given themselves up for lost and fatalistically await the grim fate they know lies before them.

Occasionally, the fin of a shark breaks the surface or a sahaugin pops its head up to look around. If they are overmatched, the sahuagin will strike for the shoreline with their captives, hoping to make it to a shoal or inlet too shallow for a larger ship to follow. 

## The City Ruins

_Map:_ [Lahoor Map](LahoorMap.jpg)

Except for the Citadel, the city is overgrown with jungle. The districts on the west bank of the river are mostly flooded, with those west of the wall being covered by mangrove swamp.

The walls and square towers of the city were built with laterite blocks surfaced with sandstone quarried from the mountains to the north and floated down the river by barge. Towers and other structures are of sandstone blocks laid with skill and often ornamented with carvings. The architecture is distinguished by the redented, ogival outline of the tower roofs, columned galleries, and corbeled arches over windows and doorways. This style leaves plenty of projecting corners and niches, which are filled with statues representing humans, gods, and demons.

### Districts

#### A) North Commoners

This area is covered in mangrove swamp. The buildings here were mostly wood and stucco and have long rotted away. Only the stone-paved roads are more-or-less visable as channels between the tangled trunks roofed by mangrove canopy. Only canoes and boats of less than 2' draft can hope to make way here.

#### B) South Commoners

Much the same as the North Commoners district, except that the ground is higher toward the south.

#### C) Mercantile

This area is flooded along the banks of the river and its tributary. The buildings here were mostly built of brick or laterite blocks and their walls stand here and there above the weed-choked waters. Nearer the walls, vine-grown, roofless buildings stand under the canopy of the trees. The bridge was built of large blocks of sandstone. Its central piers have collapsed and the rubble between them is a hazard to navigation. 

#### D) Warehouse

Much the same as the mercantile district, except that the buildings were larger and mostly constructed of wood and stucco, so fewer walls remain.

#### E) Artisans

This district is mostly above water except along the banks of the tributary. The buildings here were built of wood and stucco, so only raised mounds remains.

#### F) Scribes

This area is flooded along the banks of the river and its tributary. The buildings here were mostly built of brick or laterite blocks and their walls stand here and there above the weed-choked waters. The bridge was built of large blocks of sandstone. Its central piers have collapsed and the rubble between them is a hazard to navigation.

#### G) Temples

This district is above water, although it is laced with small pools and slow-moving creeks. There are also many open areas separated by spaces overgrown with trees. The buildings, especially the temples, were built with sandstone blocks on a base of laterite.

#### H) Tradesmen

This area is flooded along the banks of the river and its tributary. The buildings here were mostly built of brick or laterite blocks and their walls stand here and there above the weed-choked waters. The bridge was built of large blocks of sandstone. Its central piers have collapsed and the rubble between them is a hazard to navigation.

#### I) Entertainment

The bank of the river in this area was shored up with stone. The piers are long since rotted away, but their stone abutments still project into the water at intervals along the bank.

The South Gate is particularly well preserved. Although it is overgrown with moss and creepers, its arch is intact and its bas-relief carvings are still plainly visible.

#### J) Nobles

The bank of the river in this area was shored up with stone. The piers are long since rotted away, but their stone abutments still project into the water at intervals along the bank. This district is entirely above water and the trees are more sparse here than elsewhere. The buildings, especially those of the palace, were built with sandstone blocks on a base of laterite. The streets were made of well-laid blocks of stone and are still plainly visibile, although much cracked and heaved by the roots of the trees.

#### K) Wealthy

This district is entirely above water, although it is overgrown with jungle. The buildings were built with sandstone blocks on a base of laterite. The streets were made of well-laid blocks of stone and are still plainly visibile, although much cracked and heaved by the roots of the trees.

#### L) Clergy

In this district, the jungle has grown over the rubble of the walls and is thicker than elsewhere. The buildings were built with blocks of laterite, with columns and bases of sandstone.

#### M) Officials

The stone shorings along the bank of the river in this area were undermined by the river. The tumbled stone is a hazard to any vessel attempting to land here. The buildings were built with blocks of laterite, with columns and bases of sandstone. 

#### N) Citadel

_Map:_ Dodecahedron 2016 pg. 21 - Cinolth Citadel

The Citadel occupies a bluff that rises 50 feet above the level of the river. The outer walls were strongly-built of large sandstone blocks facing a core of rubble bound with cement. The fortress was likewise built with blocks of sandstone with stone towers at the corners. The ground is drier here than anywhere else in the city and only a few small trees and bushes grow up among the stone-flagged streets.

A flock of four **vulture harpies** and their **vulture harpy spellcaster** leader inhabit the citadel, nesting in ruined towers. They are in league with the beholder.

#### O) Military

This area is above water, except for a few places along the riverbank where the stone shorings collapsed. The jungle is thick here, but the streets are still visible as trails among the trees.

#### P) East Commoners

This area is overgrown by thick, almost impassable jungle. The buildings here were mostly wood and stucco and have long rotted away. Only the stone-paved roads are more-or-less visible as trails among the trees.

### Buildings

#### 1) Market Hall

#### 2) University

The rectangular roofs of several sandstone buildings are visible above the river water. These were part of the university that once educated the city's bureaucrats and scribes. One of the central edifices was once the university's library -- a one-story building with a high roof set solidly on an eight foot high base. An eddy in the current caused by the walls of adjoining buildings upstream keeps the water flowing through the library free of silt. The clarity of the water, the stone bars covering its windows, and a cellar with a single entrance recommended the library to the sahuagin as a headquarters and a secure place to store their treasure.

Twenty-four **sahuagin** patrol the grounds of the university, in groups of 2d6 warriors each. In addition, a **sahuagin baron** and his bodyguard of six **sahuagin knights** occupy the library.

_Treasure:_ 900 cp, 5000 sp, 900 gp, 120 pp, 18 x Pearl (100 gp), 2 x Black Pearl (250 gp) Potion of Growth (uncommon, dmg 187), 2 x Potion of Water Breathing (uncommon, dmg 188)

#### 3) Temple of the Old Ones

_Map:_ [Temple of the Old Ones Map - Levels 1 & 4](LahoorTempleOfTheOldOnesMap_1.pdf)  
_Map:_ [Temple of the Old Ones Map - Levels 2 & 3](LahoorTempleOfTheOldOnesMap_2.pdf)

The materials, construction, and architecture of this building are unlike anything else in the city. It is built with large blocks of greenish stone set without mortar so precisely that it is impossible to force even a knife-blade between them, despite their obvious antiquity. The interior walls are of the same construction. The halls and chambers are windowless and unlit, without any provision for lamps, cressets, or even torch-holders. Except in the larger chambers, there are no arches and even those are reticulated. Although the architecture features rectangular shapes, the angles are seldom square. Instead, the architects seem to have favored tricks with perspective to prompt a sense of awe and unease -- heightened by the stifling atmosphere and sense of incredible ancientness.

A **sahuagin priestess**, six **sahaugin acolytes**, and twelve **sahugin** guards are at the site on a sort of archeological expedition. The priestess is aware of the situation with the dragon turtle, which is not common knowledge among the sahuagin.  

A number of magical effects in the temple can inflict short-term or long-term madness on a character. If the number of times a character is so afflicted while in the temple exceeds 2 plus the character's Wisdom or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher), the character acquires an indefinite madness. 

##### 1A) Entry Portico

The stone above the entryway is decorated with a weathered bas-relief frieze. It depicts a group of unsettlingly alien humanoids engaged in acts that may be interpreted as homage to a central group of much larger figures that look like a cross between a lamprey and a squid. The capitals of the two columns are sculpted as the heads of three squid-like creatures whose tentacles snake down the pillars to a base carved in the form of humans crushed and writhing beneath an oppressive load.

##### 1B) Entry Hall

Mud from seasonal flooding cakes the floor of the hall for the first twenty feet, but strangely does not extend beyond this even though the hall slopes down once it gets past the passageways to the flanking chambers. A successful DC 10 Wisdom(Perception) check will find the footprints of numerous sahuagin in the mud and tracking into the hall and passageways.

The passageways were once hung with curtains which have rotted away, leaving behind only the heavily-oxidized bronze curtain rods and rings.

##### 1C) Vestibule

The mud extends 10 feet into this chamber, which is otherwise empty.

##### 1D) Mural Room

The curtains of this room have disentigrated like the curtains in the hallway. The west wall was once decorated with a mural depicting the emergence of the Old Ones from the Sea of Chaos, but the paint has all but vanished.

##### 1E) The Spider's Lair

A **giant spider** lurks at the end of this room among the bones and skulls of its victims -- mostly large lizards.

##### 1F) The Guard Chamber

The dessicated corpse of a sahuagin lies before the curtain on the other side of this room. The curtain itself has not decayed. It is a heavy affair of thick silk brocade woven in disturbing patterns of dark purple on a dark red background. The brass rings and curtain rod are untarnished.

A **poison gas trap** triggered by magnets concealed inside the curtain rings guards the curtained doorway. It is well hidden -- Wisdom(Perception) DC 16 to detect. Once detected, an Intelligence(Investigation) DC 16 check will reveal tiny holes concealed amid the carved ornamentation of the doorway. If triggered, the trap will fill the room with a poisonous gas, which will linger for 1d6 turns. Any creature that starts its turn in the area of effect must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and is rendered unconscious for 1d6 rounds. A creature unconscious in this way automatically fails subsequent saves for additional damage, but the duration of unconsciousness is not changed. 

##### 1G) The Throne Chamber

The curtain of this room is intact and is identical ot the one to the Guard Chamber. The room is empty except for a throne made of demon bones, teeth, and horns bound with platinum wire to a hidden frame of welded adamantine rods.

A creature with an Intelligence above 4 that begins its turn sitting in the throne must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is incapacitated and experiences a terrifying vision that inflicts 3d6 psychic damage and short-term madness.

##### 1H) The Fossil Chamber

In the center of this room is what appears to be a statue of an alien creature sculpted from serpentine in minute detail. The creature is eight feet tall and has an oblong body that is hexogonal in cross-section. At the base of the body are three stubby tentacles, which may be described as feet by their function if not their appearance. At the crown is a three-cornered mouth fringed with fine tentacles and ringed with rows of sharp, pointed teeth. Three quarters of the way up on each of the creature's six sides is a small bat-like wing over which is a bulbous eye with a triangular pupil. The hide of the creature's body has a pebbled surface, while the tentacles and wings are repulsively smooth.

The statue is actually a kind of fossil created in a failed attempt to summon an Old One. It radiates magic, but is otherwise completely inert. An attempt to "restore" the creature to life by means of _stone to flesh_ or similar magic will result in an explosion of a noisome slime akin to rotten whale blubber. All creatures in a 10-foot radius of the status when this happens must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is poisoned for 4 rounds minus a number of rounds equal the the target's Constitution modifier. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated as it is violently ill. On recovery, the target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. A failure of this second saving throw afflicts the target with a short-term madness.

##### 1I) The Pool Chamber

This room is empty and featureless except for a circular pool 10 feet in diameter flush with the floor in the center of the chamber. The borders of the pool are incised with an intricate design remniscent of interwined tentacles. The pool seems to be filled almost to the brim with a substance like mercury, except that its surface is shiny and reflective, rather than dull.

The substance in the pool is actually an elemental with the same statistics and abilities as a water wierd, except for its appearance and a few additional abilities. One such extra ability is that it reflects magic back at the caster. Whenever the elemental is the target of a magic spell or effect, the caster becomes the target instead. The elemental can still be affected by indirect targeting, such as with an area of effect, in which case it benefits from resistance to magic. Another ability is that the elemental has resistance to all weapon damage, normal or magic. If the elemental drops to 0 hit points, it will be violently ejected back its native plane through a planar rift that will appear in the well. Creatures within 5 feet of the well when this happens must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 9 (2d8) cold damage, or half as much on a successful one. The planar rift, which appears as an impenetrable darkness that fills the pool, will persist for 2d6 rounds before it vanishes, revealing that the pool was only a foot deep.

##### 1J) Hall of the Crocodiles

The east wall of this hallway is carved with a bas-relief depicting a procession of creatures that have human bodies and crocodilian heads. The creatures wear kilts and broad collars and bear staves or curved swords. At the head of the procession, a larger figure wearing an elaborate headdress bears a small coffer.

##### 1K) The Prison of Kyusryss

At the end of this room is a slab of translucent pink stone of the same dimensions as a sarcophagus. It is ornately carved in an intricate geometric motif, but of a disturbingly non-Euclidean sort. 

The slab is an extradimensional prison -- much like those associated with the _imprison_ spell, except that it holds its inmates in a non-material form as charges of arcane energy trapped among the crystalline lattice of the stone. The stone imprisons a number of ancient enemies of the cult of the Old Ones, but the secret by which they may be released is long lost. No force can damage the prison while the spell lasts.

A creature with an Intelligence score of at least 4 that spends at least one round contemplating the slab must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and is afflicted with a short-term madness due to horror at the uncanny nature of the object.

##### 1L) Vestibule

This chamber is empty, except for the mud and debris on the floor that extends 10 feet into the room.  

##### 1M) The Pit

From the entryway the room appears empty, but a powerful chanel odor wafts from it into the adjoining chamber. On a successful DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check, a character will notice that the floor is entirely free of the dirt and debris found in the adjoining rooms.

This entire room is a **pit trap**. The floor is an illusion covering a pit 20 feet deep. Jagged, pale-green crystals with razor-sharp edges grow on the floor of the pit. The rotting corpse of a sahuagin lies at the bottom, along with the bones of a number of less-recent victims. A creature that enters the room must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and an additional 13 (3d8) piercing damage. A creature that starts its turn in the pit having taken piercing damage from the crystals must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a successful DC 14 Wisdom(Perception) check, a character can see through the illusion.

##### 1N) The Obsidian Mirror

An oddly-cut slab of black stone is mounted in a niche in the south wall of this chamber. It's surface is polished to such a degree that it acts as a mirror. However, if a character spends more than 1 round looking in it, he will see his reflection become clouded over -- after which the clouds will dissipate to reveal a vast star-scape full of unfamiliar constellations. Other than to give the viewer a vague sense of unease, the mirror has no other effect, as its intended use as a communication portal between worlds depends on a ritual that was lost centuries ago.

##### 2A) The Great Hall

This wide hallway slopes down past three portals on the left and one on the right. The posts and lintels of the portals are ornamented with carved borders featuring a motif in which horrified men and women are entwined in masses of intertwined tentacles. 

##### 2B) The Great Vestibule

The ceiling of this large chamber is barely 10 feet high. The west wall features a mural that depicts a nightmarishly alien city that, strangely, appears devoid of inhabitants. The north and south walls are covered by massive curtains of black silk woven in an intricate, but irregular, texture. The posts between the portals on the east wall are carved in the shape of plants, or perhaps creatures, with winding tendrils that end in saw-toothed leaflets and bulbous pods, obscenely dehiscent. 

##### 2C) The Assembly Chamber

The overall post and lintel architecture of the building reaches its zenith in this, the largest of the temple's chambers. The untarnished bronze doors are unlocked and may be easily opened by means of ornate pulls wrought in the shape of monsters of the deeps. The doors, pillars, capitals, and architraves are decorated with intricate bas-relief work, the intertwined patters of which have an insidious effect on the mind.

There are ten doorways in the walls of the chamber, only three of which are occupied by actual doors that lead to adjoining chambers. The other seven are occupied by doorways that open onto portals to other places, planes, and even dimensions. All the doors share the property that, when closed, their doorways do not exist in the place the door opens onto. The doors open inward to the chamber and close of their own accord in three rounds unless held open. The doors in order clockwise around the room are:

**Door 1:** Exit to the Great Vestibule

**Door 2:** Portal to Tolengul. This door opens on a dark alley in the city of Tolengul.

**Door 3:** Portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire. A blast of heat like that of an oven scorches a 5 foot area when this door is opened. This doorway opens on an island in a bay of a great lava sea, the Sea of Fire. On the heights of a promontory that juts into the bay, the spires of the fabled City of Brass shine in the the flickering aurora of flame that eternally lights the sky.

**Door 4:** Portal to the Deeps of Space. When this door is opened, a freezing blast extends into the room. Creatures within 5 feet of the door must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept into the void of space.

**Door 5:** Exit to 2P  

**Door 6:** Portal to the Mountains of Kulzigal. This door opens on a high mountain pass in Kulzigal. Snow swirls into the room from the blizzard raging beyond the doorway.

**Door 7:** Portal to the Drowned City. This door opens on a wall of dark blue water, suprising a school of fish, which turn as one creatre and dash away. Beyond the doorway, a collonade of pillars, ruined and encrusted with marine life, marches away into the dark depths.  

**Door 8:** Portal to Limbo. The door opens on a scene of unimaginable chaos. A great slab of rock, like the prow of a ship, extends from the doorway above a oily-surfaced lake that bubbles and seethes. Above this, a hillock of blue crystals floats in the orange sky. Lightning plays between the facets of the tower-sized crystals. Suddenly, the lake freezes over with greenish-blue ice, which immediately cracks into myriad shards which melt and fall upward like a reverse rainstorm, leaving a vast crater floored with hardened lava behind. Simultaneously, the floating blue crystals turn a dull, gray, metallic hue and break off to plunge into the bed of the former lake. These spikes then are transformed into tall forms like trees, which then catch fire and burn like torches as the sky darkens to an angry charcoal gray through which hurtle meteors of diamond. 

**Door 9:** Portal to Minarous. A feotid stench pervades the area of the doorway as soon as the door is opened. The doorway looks out over a vast, stinking bog under a brown sky that drizzles an acid rain that collects in oily pools and drains away in rivulets between the blasted stumps of once-mighty trees. Across a yawning chasm at the top of a cliff of sharp-edged flint is a giant-sized citadel with walls of weathered, rust-red stone.

**Door 10:** This door opens on a blank wall, the stones of which are cracked and blasted. This is actually an illusion placed on the entranceway to the Catacombs.

##### 2D) The Catacombs

The west wall of this low-ceilinged, wide hallway is honeycombed with crypts, each of which is sealed by a serpentinite marker carved with strange designs and characters of an unknown script. A character that uses _Comprehend Languages_ or similar magic to understand the writings must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is afflicted with a short-term madness due to the blasphemous names carved on the markers.

Most of the crypts hold the mummified remains of a cultist or cult leader -- some of which were interred with wealth. Each crypt takes 1d3 minutes to open with a successful DC 12 skill check with thieves' tools. Undead have Individual Treasure according to their CR, while mummified corpses have Individual Treasure of CR 2d4 (roll again for results indicating treasure in cp). Traps are Wisdom(Perception) DC 15 to find and Intelligence(Investigation) DC 15 to disable.

##### 2E) Crypt of the Keeper

The door to the crypt seems to have been cast in one piece from a strange, purplish metal. It fits tightly into its stone frame and has no pulls, handles, or locks. The door is decorated in bas-relief in the semblance of a nightmarish monstrosity -- a squamous mass flanked by tentacles and clusters of eyes and split by a gaping mouth from which protrude long, daggerlike, interlocking teeth. A successful DC 20 Wisdom(Perception) check by a character inspecting the door within 5 feet of it will reveal that teeth are caked with dark stains.

The door is a magical construct, a **guardian portal**. If a creature touches the door, it will animate and attack.

#### 4) Temple of the Snake God

_Map:_ [Temple of the Snake God Map](LahoorSnakeTempleMap.jpg)

Ruins of a temple to Sithryss. A coiled-serpent motif predominates the surviving ornamentation carved into the sandstone that forms the main temple.

The ruins are the haunt of a **medusa**, who will take advantage of her knowledge of the terrain to strike from ambush.

#### 5) Ampitheater

#### 6) Great Bridge

#### 7) Tower of the Sorcerer

_Map:_ [Sorcerer's Tower Map](LahoorSorcerersTowerMap.jpg)

This tower is the lair of a **beholder** named Nytharlax, a rather sorry specimen of its species who withdrew here out of fear of a conspiracy of its enemies. At a distance, Nytharlax's skinny, pale brown body and long, segmented eyestalks suggests a flying spider. Up close, its large, yellow central eye with its slitted iris and needle-like teeth give it a snakish look. As repulsive as its looks are, the beholder's personality is even more uncomfortable. It is uncommonly paranoid, even for its kind, and it speaks with an air of persecution and depression.

Nytharlax has cowed the vulture harpies into serving as its watchdogs. It is aware of the sahuagin and suspects that they were sent here by its enemies. It has not yet decided what to do about them, but has instructed the vulture harpies to keep it informed of their movements.  

#### 8) Palace

#### 9) Abbey

#### 10) Barracks

#### 11) Shipyards

Near the stone piers along the riverbank are several large buildings sturdily built of sandstone with stone-tiled roofs that are leaky, but intact. These buildings were used to build and refit ships, but they are now surrounded by a post-and-wattle wall eight feet high so as to form a barracoon to hold the eighty **commoner** captives the sahuagin have taken. The same post-and-wattle construction has been used to block up the wide doors of some of the larger buildings which were used in shipbuilding. Twenty **sahuagin** guard the grounds to prevent the escape of any captives.

If rescued, the Quetalpa tribesfolk can tell the party that they were taken in raids of several coastal villages over the past week. Some of the captives will also offer that the sahuagin also took quantities of pearls produced by divers of their villages.

#### 12) Observatory

The observatory is a two-story rectangular building from which a four-story round tower protrudes. The tower has a dome made of stone, which is intact. An oculus at the apex of the tower lets light into the interior, illuminating the stone stairs that wind around the inside. The upper floors were constructed of wood planks supported by wooden beams, but only the corbels on which the timbers were once set remain. This provides an ideal shelter for birds. River swallows roost in the building by the hundreds.
