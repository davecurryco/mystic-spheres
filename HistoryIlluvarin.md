# History of the Illuvarin

Both branches of the Illuvarin number the years continuously beginning with their arrival in Eldarionamanye (Iss-Elderion). For example, Illuvarin scribes might record that a certain event happened _acalume_ 1524, "in the year after Arrival 1524":

Acalumanye, The Arrival; Illuvarin arrive in Eldarionamanye (Iss-Elderion).

Elderion the Bright founds Silyelin, the City of the Sun.

Cirdarian the Navigator founds the town of Varandanya on the bay of Denyessemanye (Iss-Eilassia) at the mouth of the Cuinilanya River.

_Ilyonnamareyon_, The Lesser Sundering; Brethenel the Grey leads the Elesanni (the Renouncers) to Iaellon.

Brethenel founds Filyalonn, the City of the Stars.

Ceredin the Dauntless leads the Alyaquende to southern Iaellon and founds _Nintelanye_. Elves of the Alayaquende drive Telenar settlers from Iaellon.
