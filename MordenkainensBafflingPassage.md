# Mordenkainen's Baffling Passage

_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a tube carved from ebony)  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

You conjure an extradimensional passage in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its two entrances are located. The entrances shimmer faintly and can be up to 10 feet wide and 10 feet tall. The entrances must be within 60 feet of each other on the same plane of existence, but need not have the same spatial orientation. Creatures can pass through the passage in both directions and travel normally while within. Objects cannot enter the passage unless they are worn or carried. You can open or close either entrance if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, an entrance is invisible. Between the entrances is a passage or staircase of featureless stone. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm and lit with bright ambient light.

You can further refine the spell so that only certain creatures may enter the passage according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that may enter, such as those who say a certain password.

When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to one of the entrances (equal chance).

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can designate an additional entrance or exit for each slot level beyond 5th. Such additional entrances or exits are one-way and can be no further than 60 feet from any other entrance or exit. Also, for each slot level beyond 6th, you can increase the maximum distance between the entrances and exits by 20 feet. In addition, you can set separate conditions on passage between each set of entrances or exits (for example, all creatures may pass through the entrances, but only dwarves may pass through the additional exit).
