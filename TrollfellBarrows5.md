# Trollfell Barrows

## The Crossing to Cymmyrion

### Abandoned Camp

The exploration of Nethruzal’s barrow took several days. Harastor’s company built a camp a mile away, out of the influence of the Shadow Realm, as a base of operations. Its remains can still be discerned (Nature DC 17), particularly the stone-lined fire pit and the stones arranged as the foundation of the supply tent. The most interesting item to be found here is graffiti scratched into the soft stone of the cliff face a little way from the camp where a few stunted bushes cluster at the mouth of a gully. In Ophari, it reads:

_May Harastor the Impetuous, our esteemed employer, reward Kerenbath the Cook by feeding Kenenbath’s living intestines to demons of the seventh ring of Hell. Then would Kerenbath know the pangs which I experience even now from his purgative stew of dried goat meat and rice seasoned with chilies. Then would justice be rightly served._

An expert (Arcana DC 13, Religion DC 13) will note that demons are denizens of the Abyss, not of Hell and can deduce (Insight DC 13) that the author was ignorant of such matters.

### Obelisk of Guard

A quarter of a mile from the camp, a rough obelisk of black stone looms out of the fog at the mouth of a ravine that opens on the valley. The obelisk is 60 feet high and has two smoothed faces, front and back, each etched with weathered Azruun runes. Some sections of the runes are still plainly legible, but others have been completely effaced. A character who can read the runes can make a DC 17 Arcana check to learn that the runes on the front side of the obelisk are mostly ones of concealment, while the runes on the back are mostly concerned with planar magic. A second DC 23 Arcana check will discover that the enchantments spelled out by the runes have lost most, but not all of their power. With a third DC 17 Arcana check, a character can evaluate that it is the enchantments of concealment that have suffered the great majority of the loss. Following this, a DC 17 Insight check can discern that the ravine and the obelisk itself would probably not be visible if it were not for this erosion.

Creatures of the natural world (including mounts and animal companions) will flatly refuse to proceed past the obelisk to the ravine. If the party chooses to enter the ravine, they will note that the fog seems to deepen as they proceed past its mouth. The ravine narrows until it is only possible to progress in single file along the dry bed of a creek that cuts deeply into the cliffs. After a little way, the party will reach a point at which the mortal world intersects with the Shadow Realm:

Suddenly, you feel as if you were falling and stagger forward. As you put out your hands to brace yourself, the feeling of vertigo stops just as abruptly as it began. The dank fog seems to take on an even more oppressive feel. The air takes on a fetid smell and even the ground beneath your feet feels unsure if not treacherous.

A DC 17 Religion check will reveal that the characters have crossed over into Cymmirion, or Blightland, as halflings refer to it. Here the characters are subject to ambient necrotic energy. Creatures of the mortal world in this zone will recover one less healing surge for each consecutive extended rest they take. So, for example, they regain their total healing surges minus one after the first extended rest, they recover their total healing surges minus two after the second extended rest, and so on. The party will not know this until they experience the effects.

After a half-mile, the ravine climbs out onto a plateau surrounded by more cliffs. The fog lifts, but the slate-grey sky is, if anything, even gloomier. Near the top of the ravine, the party will find another barrow, a large mound constructed of  blocks of dressed sandstone tightly laid in a spiral pattern.

## 5: Barrow of Nethruzal (Azruun Diabolist Master)

_Unoccupied and plundered_

Harastor the Impetuous, a Ophari wizard, tracked down the location of this barrow and recruited a party of adventurers to help him plunder it. They penetrated to the burial chamber of Nethruzal, who had been a member of Narastur's Circle of Seven. The robbers penetrated the tomb's defenses until they reached the chamber containing the Azruun diabolist's mummified body. Harastor's unwise use of a ritual to attempt to glean arcane secrets from the dead sorceror awoke Nethrazul, who immediately subjected Harastor and his companions to the most gruesome of endings. The resurrected diabolist left the lifeless, soulless husks of the adventurers on the floor of his burial chamber and summoned a shadow-steed to seek his reincarnated master.

Harastor's adventurers thoroughly explored this tomb, defeated or triggered its traps, and had their hirelings pack up the plunder as they went. After the deaths of their masters, the hirelings fled and attempted to make it back to Ophar on their own. The only treasure to be found in this barrow is on the bodies of the hapless adventurers.

### Entrance

The entrance to this dolmen is warded by a thick door carved of a curious red marble shot through with black veins and carved with intertwined serpents in bas-relief. The carving cleverly exploits the veins in the marble to give the carving the appearance that it is crawling as the viewer's perspective changes. This effect is most pronounced in torchlight.

Inspection of the door will reveal that the carvings are movable in an intricate pattern that locks the door (Perception DC 19, Thievery DC 15). Closer inspection (Perception DC 25, Thievery DC 21) will discover a recess that once held a metal seal, but it is now missing. The door was opened and the seal was plundered by Harastor's adventurers. The door is still unlocked and is even ajar by a few inches.

### Antechamber

The floor of this high-ceilinged chamber is mostly covered in rubble to a depth of more than a foot in the deepest places near the back wall. The floor directly in front of the door on the opposite side is clear. Careful inspection (Perception DC 17, Thievery DC 13) will reveal that this is because the wall in which the exit door is situated collapsed outward. Expert inspection (Thievery DC 17, Dungeoneering DC 19) will disclose a trigger mechanism in the door  frame that released a spring-loaded beam at the top of the wall that pushed a foot-thick false wall of stone outward to topple into the chamber, which probably would have killed anyone in the chamber except someone standing directly in front of the door.

Near the back of the room, the skeletons of two warriors in rusted helmets and ring armor lie mostly buried in the rubble. Their shields lie cast atop the debris, but their weapons are nowhere to be found. There are no valuables on the bodies. A close inspection (Perception DC 19) will reveal that their purses and dagger sheaths have been cut from their belts. A careful evaluation (Dungeoneering DC 17) will be able to determine that the artifacts are decades, rather than centuries, old.

The door leading out of the chamber is made of rusted iron, wrought in twisted, serpent shapes. Its handles are fashioned in the shape of winged serpents. The door has an integrated lock, but it hangs open. Expert inspection (Thievery DC 17, Dungeoneering DC 19) will reveal that the lock was trapped, but in a way that was simple to defeat (Thievery DC 13). Both the lock and its trap were, in fact, defeated long ago and are now so frozen with rust that the trap can never again be triggered.

### Main Hall

The main hall of the barrow leads from the antechamber and winds around it. Its ceiling is a comfortable 8 feet high and is reinforced with pilasters and beams of charcoal-grey basalt. A portcullis leads to the Guardian Burial Chamber. Shortly thereafter, an open pit trap 30 feet deep gapes in the floor. At the bottom are flagstones matching the floor of the main hall, shards of broken pottery, and rubble matching that in the Antechamber. Expert inspection (Thievery DC 17) will reveal that the shattered clay pots at the bottom of the pit once held powders in two compartments that, when mixed by the breaking of the pot, produced a (presumably toxic) reaction. The pots were apparently broken by someone dropping pieces of rubble from the Antechamber on them from above.

Around the corner, the hall leads past the partly-open door to the Offering Chamber. Immediately beyond that, the floor slopes at a 45-degree angle 20 feet down to a second open pit trap at the intersection of the main hall and the lower hall. Expert inspection (Thievery DC 17, Dungeoneering DC 19) will note scrape-marks on the walls and closely-set flagstones that indicate that the floor dropped away abruptly to its current pitch in order to slide intruders into the pit. The pit itself is 30 feet deep and its floor is set with 2-foot long iron spikes.

### Outer Guardian Chamber

Behind a wrought-iron portcullis, a small chamber contains a black stone sarcophagus. The portcullis is closed, but can be raised with a standard DC check. Careful inspection (Perception DC 19, Thievery DC 17) will reveal faint traces of a magic circle scribed in chalk on the floor in front of the portcullis.

Inside the chamber, the sarcophagus is carved with borders of Azruun runes and its lid is decorated with runes surrounding a central design of a winged serpent inset in red granite. Careful inspection will reveal pry-marks around the seal of the lid and it can easily be opened with tools or a good shove (Strength DC 15).

Inside the sarcophagus lies the mummified body of an Azruun warrior in lamellar armor and clasping the hilt of a great-sword laid on his chest. The armor and sword are far too decayed and rusted to be of any use. The corpse has been robbed of anything of value.

These are the remains of one of Nethruzal’s bodyguard, left here to serve his master in the afterlife. His ghost still haunts the chamber, but since Nezruthal has left, the ghost will only manifest and attack if the remains in the coffin are disturbed.

Tormenting Ghost (Level 21 Controller)

The ghost will attack by surprise and use Burst of Terror against the creature who disturbed its remains. If this is successful, the ghost will push the creature out of the chamber and down the Main Hall into the pit trap. The ghost will then cause the portcullis to fall (if it is open and is not being held open) and will use Ghostly Terrain centered in the chamber in order to immobilize creatures within while it singles out one foe for Ghostly Possession.

### Lower Hall

The Lower Hall is of the same general construction as the main hall. Partly-open iron doors lead to the False Treasure Chamber and the Ossuary Chamber.

### Ossuary Chamber

This tiny chamber holds four stone ossuaries, each containing the bones of nine of Nethruzal’s former servants. The stone lids have been removed from the ossuaries and their contents have been thoroughly rifled.

### False Treasure Chamber

This small chamber contains a large chest of black marble with gilded borders and carved runes. Its lid is closed. Before it sprawls a skeleton of a small human dressed in long-decayed leather armor. Its condition dates it to a few decades before the present (Dungeoneering DC 19). There is no treasure or weaponry to be found on the body.

The chest can be opened at will, as it is no longer locked. It once bore a lethal ward, but this was discharged on the unfortunate thief who still lies before it. However, the chest is completely empty, as it never contained any treasure to begin with. Instead, this room was a false treasure chamber, designed as a death-trap for grave-robbers. Expert inspection (Thievery DC 17, Dungeoneering 19) will reveal that the room contains a number of traps that have been disabled. The chest itself sits on a trigger plate in the floor, a series of holes worked into the serpent-motif at the base of the walls have been plugged with wax, the false front of one of the dressed stones of the wall has been pried open, and a set of bronze gears behind it have been jammed with iron spikes. A successful skill check (Dungeoneering DC 19) will reveal that these artifacts are also only a few decades old.

### Inner Antechamber

This chamber is constructed of fine granite with an arched ceiling 10 feet high supported by pilasters. The floor is polished black marble. A secret door in one corner (Perception DC 23) hides a staircase leading up. Centered along the wall opposite the entrance door, a slab of red granite stands vertically on a base of black marble. The forward face of the slab is flat and smooth. Near the top is an incised, circular design of a serpent with bat-like wings bordered by a circle of Azruun runes. This is the Sigil of the Circle of Seven. Beneath this are columns of Azruun runes that spell out an ancient curse:

Stele of Madness Level 15 Elite Lurker

Trap XP 2,400

The upright slab of stone ahead is inscribed with arcane runes, and it radiates a disturbing feeling of unease and dread.

Trap: Taking the form of a large upright slab of stone inscribed with arcane runes, this stele attempts to overthrow the minds of those who view the writing.

The trigger area is the entire stele. It affects only those creatures who are not initiates of the Circle of Seven, their servants or their conjurings.

Perception  
No check is required to see the stele.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 27: The character recognizes the nature of the stele.  

Initiative +10

Trigger  
When creatures unaffiliated with the Circle of Seven enter the area, the trap activates and rolls initiative. The trap continues its attacks until no living unaffiliated creatures remain in the area.

Attack (Twice per Turn)  
Standard Action Ranged sight  
Target: One creature who can see the trap.  
Attack: +19 vs. Will  
Hit: Target is dominated (save ends).  
Aftereffect: Target is dazed (save ends).  
Effect  
The trap forces dominated creatures to perform a random action each round on the target's turn:

| d20 Roll | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
|      1-2 | Make most powerful attack against nearest ally |
|      3-4 | Make melee basic attack against nearest ally |
|      5-6 | Destroy a held or worn item |
|      7-8 | Discard a held or worn item |
|     9-10 | Use most powerful remaining daily or encounter power in the least beneficial way |
|    11-12 | Use a daily or encounter power in the least beneficial way |
|    13-14 | Move into a square adjacent to the stele and attempt to decipher its runes to the exclusion of all else (target grants combat advantage) |
|    15-16 | Move into the stele's square and vanish. Return 1-6 rounds later in an adjacent square having taken 3d6 + 8 necrotic damage |
|    17-18 | Move as fast as possible away from the stele in a random direction |
|    19-20 | Fall prone and bow to the stele (target grants combat advantage) |

Countermeasures  
* A character can attack the stone (AC 26, other defenses 24; HP 125; resist 10 all). Destroying the stele disables the trap.
* A character can blindfold himself or use other means to avoid seeing the runes on the stele. Doing this brings the usual penalties to attack and defenses.
* A character can cover the stele with a drapery or other cover.

The Sigil of the Circle of Seven inscribed on the face of the stele has its own powers. On the round after the stele attacks and each round thereafter for seven rounds, the sigil will summon a shadow shard into the chamber or the adjacent halls.

Shadow Shard (Level 12 Artillery)

### Inner Guardian Chamber

Another portcullis of wrought iron opens on a chamber containing a black stone sarcophagus. However, this portcullis is not rusted and the contents of the chamber appear intact.

The sarcophagus is essentially a decoy trap, one that the previous adventurers were warned of and avoided:

Shadow Wave Level 19 Blaster

Trap XP 2,400

The object ahead suddenly glows deep purple with dark power, and a wave of necrotic energy rushes forth, smashing into you like an ocean wave.

Trap: When a creature steps into a square adjacent to a particular object, often an altar, portal, or other obvious item of power, the object starts to exude necrotic energy that pushes living creatures away.

Perception  
Characters can’t use Perception to detect this trap.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 31: The character recognizes the object as the focus of a necrotic energy trap.

Initiative +12

Trigger  
When a creature steps into a square adjacent to the focus object, the trap activates and rolls initiative. The trap attacks on its initiative in each round for the next three rounds.

Attack  
Standard Action Close burst 5  
Target: All creatures in burst  
Attack: +22 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 3d12 + 5 damage and push 3 squares and knock prone. Shadow creatures and undead are not pushed or knocked prone and take no damage, but instead regain 10 hit points.  

Countermeasures  
An adjacent character can disable the trap with a DC 31 Thievery check.  
A character can attack the focus object (AC 30, other defenses 27; hp 69). Destroying the focus disables the trap.  

### Level 2 Hallway

Eight feet above the grey granite floor, the slightly arched ceiling of this hallway is tiled with red porphyry and is supported by pilasters of black porphyry. The pilasters are carved with hundreds of intertwined serpents. Observant characters might notice (Perception DC 23) that the shadows of these carvings seem to writhe even in steady light.

A door of bronze decorated in a serpent motif at one end of the hall opens on a blank wall. The door is undamaged and locked (Thievery DC 23 to open), but it is not trapped. Instead, if the door is opened, the shadows of the serpent carvings on the pilasters will leap out to attack. The shadows are treated as if they were shadow snakes, but of tiny size. Harastor’s research warned him of the hazard and he and his party of adventurers simply left the door alone.

6 Shadow Snakes (Level 16 Skirmisher)

The shadow snakes are considered to have concealment due to the shadows. They will not leave the hallway or staircase, but their reach allows them to attack into adjoining rooms.

### Treasure Chamber

Another bronze door decorated in the same serpent motif bears the marks of forcible entry (Perception DC 17 to notice) and is unlocked. Inside, a large chamber was once stuffed with grave goods, but it has been thoroughly looted. Two large stone coffers stand along one wall. Their lids lie haphazardly propped against the walls. Both are empty.

### Crypt Antechamber

A bronze door at the end of the hall has also been forcibly opened (Perception DC 17). It too is unlocked. The door opens on a small chamber with floors and walls of grey granite and an eight-foot ceiling decorated with a trellis of red marble carved in an intricate pattern of intertwined serpents.

An alcove in the wall opposite the door contains a rectangular, black porphyry pedestal carved with Azruun runes. On it rests a purple-black crystal, which is, in fact a trap. A character adjacent to the pedestal may notice that the floor at its base is littered with scraps of long-ago disintegrated wool and leather.

Lifetrap Crystal Level 22 Elite Blaster

Trap XP 8,300 

A strange, many-faceted crystal suddenly emits blasts of coruscating purple-black light.

Trap: This large crystal is often placed on a pedestal where it can command an entire room. When a creature steps within 5 squares of the crystal, it starts emitting blasts of necrotic power from its many facets.

Perception  
DC 27: The character spots glimmers of purple-black light playing within the strange crystal.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 33: The character recognizes the lifetrap crystal.

Initiative +12

Trigger  
When a creature moves within 5 squares of the lifetrap crystal, it rolls initiative and attacks.

Attack   
Standard Action Close blast 5  
Target: All creatures in the blast  
Attack: +25 vs. Fortitude  
Hit: 3d10 + 5 necrotic damage and ongoing 5 necrotic damage and stunned (save ends). The crystal makes a secondary attack.
Aftereffect of stun: Dazed (save ends).  
Secondary Attack: +20 vs. Will  
Hit: Part of the character's life-force is drawn into the crystal. The character may not use daily powers until this life-force is released. This can only be done by a Remove Affliction performed at level 22 or above, or by destroying the crystal. However, if the crystal is destroyed with a character’s life-force inside, that character permanently loses 2 points of Constitution.
Special: For each creature’s life-force the crystal holds, its attack and damage increase by 1. If the creature dies, the crystal loses the benefit of that creature’s life-force.  

Countermeasures  
A character can engage in a skill challenge to detach the crystal from its socket and thereby disable it. DC 33 Thievery. Complexity 1 (4 successes before 2 failures). Success detaches the crystal and disables the trap. Failure causes the crystal to explode (close burst 5, 3d10 + 5 necrotic damage and stunned (save ends) to all creatures in burst). A successfully detached crystal loses its magical properties, but is worth 150 GP.  
A character can attack the crystal (AC 33, other defenses 29; hp 100; resist 15 all). When reduced to 0 hit points, the crystal explodes in a close burst 5, as above. Destroying the crystal disables the trap.  
An adjacent character can cover the crystal with a cloth or similar material. The crystal’s attacks will then go toward destroying the covering, rather than attacking the party.  

### Crypt

The bronze double-doors to the crypt are decorated with a bas-relief pattern of intertwined serpents. The handles are shaped in the form of a winged serpent, like those of the Antechamber. The verdigris-covered doors are unlocked, but it will require significant strength to open them because of the corrosion on the hinges (Strength DC 25).

The crypt chamber is sheathed in gray granite. In an alcove on the wall opposite the door, two large basins of bronze flank a bronze throne set on a dais of red granite. The throne is empty, except for a scattering of long-decayed scraps of cloth-of-gold. The basins give off an eerie, flickering, bluish light that only seems to deepen the shadows in the room.

On the floor of the crypt lie four skeletons. Two are human, one is a dwarf and the other a halfling. Close inspection (Dungeoneering DC 19) will reveal that their bones are mostly crushed. These are the remains of Harastor and his party, squeezed to death by serpents of elemental shadow released from the basins by Nethruzal upon his unexpected resurrection. Expert evaluation will reveal that the skeletons are only a few decades old (Dungeoneering DC 19). Attempts to question the corpses by means of the Speak with the Dead ritual or similar magic will fail because the adventurer’s souls were crushed. The remnants of the adventurer's gear and goods still lie among their bones, but only the magic items are still usable:

* Climber’s Bracers
* Master’s Wand of Magic Missle (Level 13 +3)
* Lens of Reading
* Battleforged Armor (Dwarven Plate, Level 10 +2)
* Bloodthread Armor (Cloth, Level 15 +3)
* Vicious Weapon (Dagger, Level 12 +3)
* Wand of Shield (Level 13 +3)
* Ruby set in a platinum pendant (5,000 GP)
* Platinum chalice with gold inner cup and set with 100 GP sapphires (2,500 GP)
* Scimitar (Level 16 +4)
* 2 gems (1,000 GP each)
* Magic Armor (Leather, Level 15)
* 12 PP
* 1,523 GP
* Ritual Book (Cleric - Hannenari)
  Gentle Repose   
  Detect Secret Doors   
  Hand of Fate  
  Cure Disease  
* Ritual Book (Wizard - Arcanic)
  Secret Page  
  Detect Secret Doors  
  Disenchant Magic Item  
  Speak with Dead (manuscript page from Codex of Narastur)  

Although there are no other items of value in this chamber, this is still quite a haul. However, if the characters want to benefit from it, they will have to defeat the four deathshade constrictors that still inhabit the basins and will attack when the opportunity seems ripe:

4 Deathshade Constrictors (Level 14 Soldier)

The basins themselves contain water from the sphere of Shadow. The light they give off, although dim, overpowers all other light sources brought into the room. The shadows produced by this light offer partial concealment to shadow creatures. All creatures in the room gain resist 5 to radiant damage.

If the characters cast a Speak with Dead ritual and question the corpses, they may discover the following facts:

* The party consisted of Harastor the Impetuous, a Hannenari wizard; Kalhar the Grim, a Hannenari fighter; Thrindel son of Galred, a dwarf cleric of Abbathor; and Lando Holdthrush, a halfling rogue.
* Harastor recruited the adventurers and six hirelings in the city of Dalaunaur. The party traveled to Shalenharazad, where they traversed a portal known to Thrindel to a cave at the mouth of a pass in the mountains of Rhunnur. They then took a raft down the Talonnin river to Delastarion, where they purchased mules. They crossed the Celadonnin River by raft and then skirted the southeast border of Iaellon to reach the Trollfells. Thrindel’s spirit will be reluctant to disclose the location of the portal (Diplomacy DC 27) since it is a secret of his sect.
* The party sought treasure in the barrows.
* The members of the party died in the coils of shadow serpents, but they had left the hirelings outside so they may have survived.

In addition, Harastor’s spirit might be persuaded to reveal additional facts:

Diplomacy DC 17  
* Harastor learned of the barrows and their likely treasures by dint of research in ancient manuscripts purchased in Alenenzer.
* The Barrow Valley is a necropolis. There are many cairns, burial caves, and small dolmens in additional to the large, obvious barrows the adventurers have seen so far. These may contain treasure.
Diplomacy DC 19  
* Harastor sought secrets of necromancy as well as treasure in the barrows.
* Parts of the Barrow Valley exist in the Aelvalon realm of Blightland and others exist in the sphere of Thanos, the Shadowfell. This was not the case when the Azruun first began using the valley as a burial-place. The pervasive necrotic influence of these places is responsible for the concentration of undead and shadow creatures in the Valley. Thanos, in particular, is not healthy for children and other living things.
Diplomacy DC 23  
* Harastor's use of the Speak with Dead ritual revivified Nethruzal, who immobilized the party with a spell of darkness and summoned the deathshade constrictors to finish the job.
Diplomacy DC 25  
* Harastor had discovered that the Speak with Dead ritual he found in a ruined temple of Shrivra in Undenar was a manuscript page from the Codex of Narastur. He had hoped to find more pages from the Codex in the barrows.
* In hindsight, it was probably a mistake to use a ritual from the Codex of Narastur to summon the shade of a diabolist master so closely associated with Narastur himself.
