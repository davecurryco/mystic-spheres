# The Ghost Bell

At the foot of a bluff among the northernmost section of the Golden Hills stand the ruins of a temple. The site has long been abandoned and is shunned by people and animals alike. The nomads who regularly pass through the area cannot or will not say to which of the many gods of the region the structures might once have been dedicated.

The ruins would scarcely be noteworthy except that travelers camping along the road between Baimin and Basrul have, on several occasions, heard the solemn note of a great bell issuing in the dead of night from the ruins they had passed by day.

Bands of nomads traveling through the area have suffered the loss of children -- snatched away in the night by someone or something unheard and unseen.

# The Sage

An hour south of the ruins, a cave opens in the side of a hill, screened by a row of cypress trees that have grown up along the banks of a creek that runs from a nearby gully. This is the post of an order of priests of Erathis established to maintain a watch against the return of the ancient evil. However, centuries of contemplation have left the order enervated. The current priest, Master Kipchu, doesn't really even worship the god of his forbears, having developed a convoluted metaphysical philosophy atop the rags and tatters of their religion. Nevertheless, the god Erathis continues to grant Kipchu powers, as he has few worshipers left.

If the adventurers locate and question Master Kipchu, he can tell them much about 

## NPCs

**Sage:** Turchak Kipchu (M, 69, Juchin, priest, LN, Glory, Muddled, Neat)

Master Kipchu wants to achieve an ultimate enlightenment through disattachment to material concerns -- and, paradoxically, to become famed for having done so. For his philosophy of transcendence, he has established a sinecure here and is careful to keep his appearance and his dwellings neat and tidy.

# The Ruins

_Map: Dodecahedron 2015 - The Temple Complex Ruins (page 7)_

All the buildings and bridges on the site are built of locally-quarried sandstone. The temple and its adjacent buildings at the northeast end of the complex are obviously long-abandoned, but are relatively intact as they were built of larger, more carefully laid blocks of stone and have multi-tiered stone roofs. The tile roofs and sections of the walls of the other buildings are collapsed. The whole site is overgrown with weeds.

## Background

Azim Alshared, an Ahlrain **necromancer** _(DMH2 page 53)_ followed a trail of research that led him to the temple site. He has discovered that sentient objects can leave spirits behind in the material world. Although the Temple Bell was shattered centuries ago, Azim has found a way to call up its "ghost" by means of a ritual involving the sacrifice of a human child. The unearthly bell acts as a channel, which the necromancer can strike it to summon the damned souls of those who worshiped the dark gods of the temple long ago. Azim aims to summon a particular spirit, that of a legendary necromancer, from whom he hopes to learn long-lost secrets of dark sorcery.

The ritual of child-sacrifice works because the original bell was cast of metal into which a live infant was thrown while it was molten. The child's cry can be heard in the bell's hum tone.

## NPCs

**Necromancer:** Azim Alshared (M, 49, Ahlrain, necromancer, LE, Amusement, Bitter, Square-jawed)

Azim studied wizardry in Basrul, but his interest in unwholesome forms of magic got him exiled. He bears a great grudge against the Yasheem judges for this. Azim is a little unhinged. He enjoys his power over the dead and it amuses him to set corpses at ridiculous tasks.

## The Bell Pavillion

A partial square of upheaved granite stairs, pavement, and toppled pillars is all that remains of the Bell House. The weed-grown square has been partially excavated. The upturned earth is shot through with fragments of blue-green tile and shards of bronze bell metal patinated to a lighter shade of almost the same hue.

## The Pool

This pool was once a sacrificial pool, but its banks are now overgrown with reeds and rank brush.

Two **ghosts**, the spirits of lovely young girls drowned together long ago as sacrifices, haunt the pool. Their spirits were summoned by the bell, but they were too restless to return. If anyone approaches the pool at night, the two will appear and show a vision of the treasure at the bottom, but their real goal is to lure the intruder into the pool and drown him.

## The Temple

This building stands 25 feet high at the peak of its roof, although it has only a single ground-level floor. Great double-doors hang open -- battered and half twisted off their hinges. The doors are made of cast bronze plates riveted to an iron frame. The plates are so heavily patinated that the only feature of their decoration still visible are rows of studs or bosses. The frame likewise is corroded to the point of crumbling and the hinges are hopelessly frozen.

There are large windows 10 feet off the ground on either side of the narthex. These are set with corroded bronze latticework.

### The Narthex

The floor of this large room is floored in stone flags several layers thick, atop which were set tiles of deep blue ceramic and grey marble, now cracked and weathered and covered in most places with wind-blown dirt and rubble from the ceiling. The walls were once covered in stucco and painted with murals, but these are so faded and decayed that all that can be discerned of them is a suggestion of flames.

A magic circle is scribed in the center of the floor in iron filings and silver dust. The circle is not magically active, but was created some time in the last few days.

### The Left Sanctum

This sanctum was dedicated to Kushyth, the Demon God of the Underworld worshipped in the Old Kingdom. An alcove on the far wall contains the rubble of a bas-relief statue of the god that was carved in black stone. The carving's humanlike legs support a torso clad in a kilt of human skulls and thigh bones. The figure's head is missing and of the original six arms, only one remains. This latter is positioned palm-forward with the fingertips down. An eye is carved in the palm. Its pupil is a black opal worth 1,000 GP. The gem bears a curse. A creature that has the gem in its possession suffers disadvantage on saving throws against necrotic damage, on saving throws against fear effects caused by undead creatures, and on death saving throws.

Six **shadows** lurk in this chamber, drawn here by Azim's dark rites.

### The Right Sanctum

This sanctum was dedicated to Sythra, the Demon Goddess of Death worshipped in the Old Kingdom. An alcove similar to the one in the Left Sanctum holds a similar bas-relief statue, of which even less remains. All that can be identified are a pair of scaly, clawed feet atop a heap of human skulls.

## The Temple Annex

This building, which adjoins the Temple, has rooms that were once used for various quasi-sacred purposes such as audience chambers and divining rooms. The roof of this building is fairly intact, particularly in its northermost section, and the rooms are dry in all but the heaviest rains, which is why the Necromancer has made this his headquarters.

### Upstairs Vestibule

The door from the bridge is heavy wood reinforced by iron, barred from the inside. The room is guarded by six **skeletons**, with orders to kill any intruders upstairs or downstairs. The skeletons will open the door to a secret code of knocks.

### Downstairs Vestibule

The door from outside is identical to the one from the Bridge to the Upstairs Vestible. Two **skeletons** guard this room. They have the same instructions as the skeletons upstairs.

## The Bridge

This bridge extends above ground level to provide access across the sharp slope from west to east.

Six **skeletons** patrol this bridge. They will clash their spears against their shields if they spot intruders.

### The Necromancer's Chambers

The northernmost suite of rooms has been refitted with new wooden doors. The door that opens on the main hall is fitted with an internal lock (DC 15) and protected by an Arcane Lock spell (+10 DC).

#### Hallway

A **flameskull** patrols this hallway on Azim's orders.

#### Bedchamber

The Necromancer's bedchamber contains simple bedding and a large apothecary's chest around the base of which a **bone naga** coils.

**Treasure:** 2400 cp, 800 sp, 60 gp, 2 x Eye agate (10 gp), Hematite (10 gp), Lapis lazuli (10 gp), Malachite (10 gp), Moss agate (10 gp), Spell Scroll (Light) (common, dmg 200), Spell Scroll (Detect Magic) (common, dmg 200), Potion of Climbing (common, dmg 187)

#### Study

The study boasts a wool carpet, atop which cushions surround a low writing-table on which books, scrolls, and manuscripts are spread open. What looks like a mummified human hand (but is actually a **crawling claw**) holds a black writing brush next to an inkstone of silver-streaked black stone.

Azim, the **necromancer** sits with his back to the door, hunched over a piece of parchment, on which is scribed a list of names arranged in nodes connected by lines, like that of a family tree. One name, that of a certain "Geziris the Elder", is underlined in red ink.

**Books and Scrolls:**

The Abyssal Scrolls of Tore: This libram is bound in bronze plates and locked. It is locked by magic, and can be opened only by firelight.

The Black Scrolls of Kimenoph: This compendium is written upon linen pages and bound in brass plates. When used in arcane research, this tome provides a +1 bonus to checks using alchemist's supplies.

The Compendium of Chtonic Lore: This ancient tome is bound in monstrous hide. Many of its pages are marked with seemingly unrelated notes.

The Demonic Esoterica of Cunu: This libram is bound in iron plates. Many of its pages are marked with indecipherable symbols. An individual who reads this tome, which requires 56 hours over a minimum of 7 days, gains a +1 bonus to Intelligence (History) checks involving demons, undead, or their planes of origin.

### Rectory

This suite of rooms was once the dwelling of the High Priest. The walls are intact, but the roof has a number of gaps, particularly near the Temple.

The doors in this part of the annex have also been replaced.

#### Hallway

Two **skeletons** stand guard at either end of the hallway.

#### Storage Rooms

The first room, which used to be the High Priest's living room, has cracks in the ceiling, but the back room is weatherproof and Azim uses it to store his supplies. The door on the southeast is barred from inside and the one in the southwest is locked with a padlock (DC 15) to which Azim has the key.

**Goods:**

* Normal food, water, and supplies for several weeks. 7 skins good wine.  
* Studded leather armor, round target shield, two daggers, longsword, light crossbow, quiver, 10 quarrels, purse (40 GP), traveller's clothes, boots (belonged to fighter) 

## The Dining Hall

Collapsed wall and roof. Empty.

A **spectre (poltergeist)** haunts this building. This is the spirit of a gluttonous priest who choked to death on a mouthful of lamb shank. The spirit was drawn here by the bell, but had such a strong connection with the place that it did not return to the afterlife.

## The Cookhouse

Mostly intact walls, but collapsed roof. Empty. The floors are covered with rubble from the ceiling, but no organic matter.

A **gelatinous cube** stalks the hall between the antechamber and the kitchen. It stays unmoving in the middle of the hallway most of the time.

### The Kitchen

A pile of bones, the remains of a victim fed to the gelatinous cube, lie in the corner. Mixed in with this is some loot.

**Treasure:** Weapon, +1 scimitar; Armor +1 leather; 220 cp, 100 sp, 6 gp

## Priests' Quarters

Building on ground-level near the Kitchen and adjoining the Commons Hall. Collapsed roof and interior wall in the hallway.

Six **skeletons** are at work clearing debris from the collapsed roof.

The west room at the end of the hall was once a priest's cell. The roof above this room is intact and its doorway has been fitted with a new wooden door. During the day, one of Amiz's bodyguards, a **wight** named Nethrazar, rests here out of the sunlight. 

## Commons Hall

Bridge-level building adjoining the Atrium. Stone roof mostly intact, but with cracks and gaps, particularly in the center section where the rain undermined the foundation and caused the floor to collapse.

Six **skeletons** are stationed in the southernmost chamber to deter intruders.

## Atrium

Entryway from the Bridge and stairs to ground-level to access the Temple. The entrance from the Bridge is an archway flanked by pilasters fashioned in a serpentine spiral and carved with scales and capitals representing a twisted mass of snakes. The ground-level entrance is flanked by caryatid pilasters fashioned in the shape of multi-armed demons standing on a base decorated with skulls and upholding a capital decorated with eyes.

## Stream Bridge

A ruined stone bridge that once spanned the stream.

# Updates

## Session 1

After expelling the adventurers, Amiz ordered his two remaining skeletons to collect the bones of the destroyed skeletons and arrange them in piles in the northwest room off the Commons Hall. He intends to reanimate them that night after he has rested. He also ordered his wights to strip the fallen player character, feed his body to the gelatinous cube, then take his belongings to the Storage Rooms. (He has forgotten to give the first part of this order in the past, which is why the cube's lair contains the treasure it does).
