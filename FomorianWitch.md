**Otherworldly Sight.** The fomorian witchâ€™s darkvision works in areas of magical darkness to its normal range. She can see the true form of any shape changer or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet and within line of sight. The formorian witch can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when she is on the Material Plane, and vice versa. The fomorian witch can also sense magic within 30 feet as if she were affected by a _detect magic_ spell.

**Spellcasting.** The fomorian witch is an 9th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The fomorian witch has 2 spell slots of 5th level and knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips (at will): _chill touch, eldritch blast, poison spray_  
1st level (4 slots): _hellish rebuke, hex, witch bolt_  
2nd level (3 slots): _crown of madness, ray of enfeeblement_

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The fomorian witch makes two vile claw attacks.

**Vile Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

**Eye of Ill Omen.** The fomorian witch magically forces a creature it can see within 60 feet of it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 32 (6d8 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

**Curse of Ill Omen (Recharge 5, 6).** When a creature fails its save against the fomorian witch's Eye of Ill Omen, as a bonus action the fomorian witch can choose to also curse the creature with ill fortune. While cursed, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attacks. A cursed creature must also roll damage dice twice and keep the lower of the two rolls.
The cursed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on a success.

Most fomorians are repellently ugly, but **Fomorian Witches** are compellingly so. Their very hideousness lends them a commanding presence, with which they harness the dark powers that have been bestowed on them. Fomorian witches wear gaudy finery and costly ornaments crafted by the dark dwarves, which makes their ugliness even more striking.
