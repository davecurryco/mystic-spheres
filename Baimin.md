# Baimin

Baimin stands at the crossroads of commerce between the tribes of the Golden Hills and the coastal cities of Pashan. It was originally founded by Alhrain traders, but was conquered by Juchin allies of the Azruun Empire, who settled in as rulers, but stayed as merchants and tradesmen. However, even today, a sizable ethnic community of Alhrain remains, replenished at intervals by refugees from the never-ending conflicts among the city-states of Pashan.

## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Bureaucracy

A governor, the _Mughad_, rules Baimin under the authority of the Shan of Khanashar. The _Mughad_ is "assisted" in this by ministers, _Wajeer_, directly appointed by the ruling council of Khanashar and charged with specific areas of responsibility. Both the Mughad and the Wajeer are frequently replaced as the balance of power in the capital shifts. Consequently, the actual task of governance tends to be delegated to career bureaucrats. As might be expected, the bureaucracy is bloated and corrupt, but it provides a stable government.

The Ahlrain minority are forbidden to own land, hold government positions, keep military weapons, or intermarry with the Juchin. In all other respects, though, the policy of the government is one of tolerance. In addition, the corruption of the bureaucracy produces a certain equality in practice. As a result, the Ahlrain of Baimin do not feel themselves to be intolerably oppressed.

## Religion

**Majority Religion:** Tamirz

The conquerors of Baimin established state worship of Tamirz, the God of Battle, in thanksgiving for their victory. The Temple of Tamirz at the crossroads is still the largest and best-supported of the city's temples, but many other gods are venerated as well. Practically all of the Juchin merchants and traders venerate Kublai, the Merchant God, as well as Tamirz. The Alhrain worship their own avatar of the Merchant God, who they call Elezzar, and only grudgingly pay the temple tax to Tamirz.

## Layout

Baimin is built around a citadel that stands atop a bluff overlooking the crossroads. The city is walled and all traffic along the roads must pass through its gates.
