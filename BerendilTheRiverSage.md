## Items

**Boots of Longstriding**  
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_
When you wear these boots, your walking speed is increased by 10 feet. You can also jump twice the normal distance, though you can't jump farther than your remaining movement would allow. A creature who dons these boots without being attuned to them will move its speed in a random direction each time it attempts to move and will have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the save succeeds, the creature can wear the boots without suffering these disadvantages, although the creature must still become attuned to the boots to use their powers.

**Staff of Oneness with Nature**  
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid)_  
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.
While holding this staff, you can move at your normal speed through difficult terrain that is due to natural conditions such as marsh, scree, or undergrowth.
The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.
Spells. You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: locate animals or plants (2 charges), speak with animals (1 charge), speak with plants (3 charges), commune with nature (5 charges).

**Berendil** is an older, but still muscular, man with shoulder-length white hair and merry blue eyes. His handsome face is clean-shaved and only mildly lined with age. He wears a leather jerkin over a shirt of blue-green linen cloth and his legs are clad in woolen trousers over soft shoes of deerskin. When abroad, he usually carries a straight walking-staff of ash wood carved with an interlace pattern featuring druidic runes. He disdains all other weapons and armor.
