## Actions

**Multiattack.** The mummy can use its _Dreadful Glare_ and makes one attack with its maul or rotting fist.

**Maul.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 19 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage (Angrim's maul of maiming always does maximum damage and will crush one of the target’s limbs on an attack roll of 20).

**Rotting Fist.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hotpoint maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.

**Dreadful Glare.** The mummy lord targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw agains this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy’s next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the _Dreadful Glare_ of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24 hours.

**Attack.** The mummy lord makes one attack with its rotting fist or uses its Dreadful Glare.

**Dazzling Bling.** The bejeweled ornaments the mummy wears blaze with flashes of multicolored magical light. Each creature within 5 feet of the mummy lord must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the creature’s next turn.

**Blasphemous Word (Costs 2 Actions).** The mummy lord utters a blasphemous word. Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of the mummy lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the mummy lord’s next turn.

**Channel Negative Energy (Costs 2 Actions).** The mummy lord magically unleashes negative energy. Creatures within 60 feet the mummy lord, including ones behind barriers and around corners, can’t regain hit points until the end of the mummy lord’s next turn.

**Angrim** was once a living dwarf and a high priest of the cult of Abbathor, the dwarven God of Greed. He acquired the fabulous gem, the [HeartOfAbbathor](HeartOfAbbathor.md), and used its power to establish himself as the virtual theocrat of the Southern Kinship. After Angrim’s avarice led to his downfall, his priests mummified his body and entombed him with the Heart of Abbathor laid on his breast. However, even they were unwilling to endure Angrim's despotism for centuries to come and so encased his mummy within a crystal sarcophagus sealed with runes of binding that kept it in stasis.

As respects _The Heart of Abbathor_, Angrim's _avarice_ is to see Sheurazak restored to its former glory and power. Accordingly, the gem empowers Angrim to infect other dwarves with a dark obsession to this end. In Angrim's hands, the artifact's major beneficial property is to grant three uses of the [Obsession](Obsession.md) spell each day. Angrim can only target dwarves with this spell and can only specify courses of action that align with his _avarice_.
