# Blackfane Spire - Upper Levels 5-7

## SU5: The Council Chambers

As Gothrog’s lieutenant, Tyriana must conspire with various other evildoers. The lavish chambers on this level provide a secure place to hold meetings.

### SU5.1 The Emissary’s Quarters

_An antechamber opens up into a larger chamber with a high ceiling. In one corner is a huge fireplace of dressed granite in which a fire has burned down to embers on iron firedogs fashioned in the shape of snarling hellhounds. A large leather sack rests on the mantlepiece. Near the fireplace is a huge chair, on which leans a massive gold-inlaid harp with thick, wide-set silver strings and a pillar at least sixteen feet tall. On the far side of the fireplace, two huge chairs flank an enormous round wooden table atop a thick carpet of black-dyed wool worked with an intricate, interlaced knotwork design. The tabletop stands above your heads, so you cannot see whether there is anything on it._

Through an open set of doors in the opposite wall, you can see a huge bed. Its broad coverlets and linens are in crumpled disarray.

Gothrog regularly sends his emissary Grizelka, a **fomorian witch**, to meet with Tyriana to convey instructions and hear progress reports. To accommodate her visits, Tyriana provides an apartment consisting of two large chambers furnished with chairs, a table, and a bed sized to match her gigantic guest. Grizelka herself is elsewhere, but she has left behind some personal treasure in the sack on the mantlepiece of the enormous fireplace:

* 120 GP
* 4 PP

The table holds the remains of Grizelka’s most recent meal, horrifically recognizable as the roasted carcass of a humanoid on a platter with a side of odd-looking fungus and a half-eaten loaf of bread three feet in diameter. A huge golden goblet set with large semi-precious stones (worth 500 GP) and partly filled with an earthy-smelling liquid stands by the trencher along with an eating-knife the size of a bastard sword.

The harp is enchanted. If it is touched by any creature other than its owner, it will play a hypnotic melody that lasts 10 minutes. Creatures within 60 feet of the harp who can hear the melody must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

Whenever the harp begins its hypnotic melody, Grizelka is instantly aware of it if she is on the same plane of existence. She can use an action to attempt possession on one creature charmed by the harp’s hypnotic melody. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be possessed; Grizelka then enters a trance and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. Grizelka now controls the body, but this doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. While in control of the target’s body, Grizelka can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and retains her alignment, Intelligence, WIsdom, Charisma, Otherworldly Sight, and spellcasting abilities. She otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Grizelka ends it as a bonus action, or she is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, Grizela comes out of her trance. The target is immune to Grizelka’s possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

Grizelka might use possession in a number of ways, depending on the circumstances. If she is curious about the party’s intentions, she might command the harp to silence and then follow along with them as the possessed creature in order to learn more. On the other hand, if she has been angered, she will possess the strongest of the charmed creatures and then use its body to attack the others.

#### SU5.2.1 The Portal Chamber

_The doors open on a large chamber that seems to be an expansion of a natural cyst within the basalt of the spire. The walls and roof seem to have been carved out, leaving pilasters and arches formed from the original stone. A section of the floor is inlaid with a mosaic of flagstones of purple porphyry interspersed with smaller tiles of colored marble to form a complex geometric knot-work pattern. On one wall is a huge archway shaped from the same purple porphyry. It seems that this should open on a passage, but only the blank wall of the chamber, hewn flat, shows between the pillars that support the arch._

The archway is a portal to the caverns of the Iron Tower. Only Grizelka knows the incantation that will open it and even she would not dare to bring creatures into Gothrog’s subterranean realm unbidden.

#### SU5.2.2 The Briefing Chamber

_You see an enormous chamber hewn from the rock in the same fashion as the portal chamber. Two huge iron braziers stand on either side of the double doors, but these are unlit. A round, wooden table and a pair of chairs sized for a giant’s frame dominate the center of the chamber. A semi-circular platform stands before the table and on it are four chairs of a more usual size. On the wall opposite the doors is an enormous banner that bears the symbol of a black tower surmounted by a black crown on a field of dark purple bordered by a knot-work motif._

On the table are several parchment scrolls, each the size of a bedspread, made from the hide of some unknown creature. Most of these are covered with a complex network of lines and arcs, annotated in a strange and cruel-looking script. However, one of the parchments is scribed with a map that is recognizable as the continent of Arestor, although it shows only the portion west and north of the border of Beranur. The forest of Iaellon is shaded in green and the Trollfells and Dhoar are shaded in purple. Annotations in red ink call out Stonewatch Pass and the Crossing Grove.

#### SU5.3.1 The Fountain Chamber

_At the center of this chamber there is a fountain of white marble that features a three-lobed vasque. From each lobe rises a life-sized statue in the likeness of a young elven woman facing outward with her limbs intertwined with those of the others. Instead of the usual spouts of water, a thick, red liquid flows from different parts of each statue. One of the women holds one hand to her throat and the red liquid sprays from between her fingers. The second proffers one arm and a red stream runs down the inside of that forearm and drips from her upturned palm. The woman depicted in the final statue bows her head and presses one hand to her bosom as red liquid gushes from a slit over her heart. The red liquid flows down the statues’ bare feet to form a dark red pool in the vasque._

Like the statues in the Gallery of Sorrows, the statues in the fountain are the petrified bodies of young elven women. Tyriana arranged for each to be bound in the correct pose, dealt a mortal wound, and then turned to stone just moments before death. The bodies were then fitted with plumbing and mounted in the fountain, where Tyriana released three blood weirds with instructions to attack any living creature that ventures into the chamber that is not accompanied by herself or Destran.

#### SU5.3.2 The Council Chamber

_Through the doors, you see a colonnade on the right. Beyond the pale marble columns is a chamber decorated with tapestries that hang between the matching columns on the opposite wall. Beneath two gilded chandeliers glittering with crystals, a large, ornately-carved table with thick pillars and inlaid decorations dominates the center of the room. Around it are eight matching chairs with plush cushions covered in dark red velvet. The table is littered with books, papers, and maps and the chairs are pushed back from the table. On the far side of the chamber is a set of double-doors carved in the same ornate style as the table and fitted with gilded hinges and handles._

Tyriana’s meeting with her co-conspirators was interrupted and the participants left hastily, intending to return soon. Consequently, there are a number of clues to their foul schemes among the papers on the table:

* A sheaf of over a hundred papyrus papers covered in Ophari script, each of which is a bill of sale for an adult male or female slave. The owner’s name varies, but a successful Investigation(Intelligence) DC 14 check will reveal that the signature on each of them is written in a distinctive hand.
* A list of Hanneshi names, each of which is followed by the name of a city or town in Hannesh and several numbers with adjoining abbreviations. These are estimates of how many slaves of what type (male, female, eunuch, warrior) each of a number of slave-merchants could supply over the course of a year and at what price. The tallies add up to over three thousand.
* A parchment ruled with lines in blue ink, between which are dwarf runes arranged in neat columns. Each is a record of a letter of credit from one of the merchant associations of the dwarven Southern Kindred.

#### SU5.3.3 The Library

The walls of this chamber are lined with bookcases filled with books. Most of them are written in elven script and a number are several centuries old.

## SU6: Tyriana’s Chambers

Tyriana lives (if that's the right word) in macabre grandeur on this level.

### SU6.1 The Portal Chamber

_As you ascend the stairs, you see that they open on a chamber lit with an dim, flickering, bluish light. When you reach the landing, you can see that the light emits from the gap of a large, ornate, stone archway that stands along one wall of the chamber. The uncertain light casts moving shadows on a set of stone steps that mounts to a platform at the threshold of another archway set into the opposite wall. The air at the top of the stairs smells like the air after a thunderstorm. You are suddenly aware of a cold draft of air that flows up from the staircase behind you and into the chamber. The hairs on the back of your neck stand up._

The large archway is a one-way magic portal that leads to a secret cavern that opens on the outer face of Blackfane Rim. Tyriana and Destran use this portal for their convenience when leaving on errands outside the spire, although they must return by another route.

At the far end of the chamber from the stairway is a short passage to a heavy door of steel forged by the dark dwarves and set into an airtight frame. It is locked and warded with traps.

### SU6.2 The Treasure Vault

The air of this small chamber smells stale and it is cluttered. Three wooden chests bound with steel bands inscribed with elven script stand along the wall farthest from the door. The one on your right gapes open. A case on the wall to your left holds six smaller coffers bound with brass, also inscribed with elven script. On the opposite wall is a counting desk on which lies an open ledger-book and a writing set. Above it is a shelf littered with books, papers, writing supplies, and various oddments. An ornate armchair with several thick ledger books stacked on its leather seat is carelessly pushed back from the desk. In the dim light of a cluster of crystal that sits haphazardly on the shelf, you see the glint of gold from stacks of coins on the desk and, even more enticingly, from the open chest.

This vault contains the greater part of Tyriana’s personal treasure. She also uses it to temporarily store funds sent by Gothrog to finance her operations. The Iron Tyrant demands that every copper piece be accounted for, lest he be cheated. Tyriana, who cares little for such bourgeois affairs, has bound a particularly intelligent **imp** named Dobreiux to the task of bookkeeping. The diminutive devil was in the middle of a disbursement when it was interrupted by the adventurers’ intrusion. It polymorphed into raven form and is crouching invisibly beneath the desk, ready to bolt down the passage at the first hint of trouble.

### SU6.3 Destran’s Crypt

_A chamber opens on the hallway across from a doorway elaborately carved in rose marble. Rose marble columns support the vaulted ceiling of the chamber and at its center a stone sarcophagus lies on a low marble dais. A black and gold banner embroidered with heraldic symbols lies atop the sarcophagus and the wall at the back of the chamber supports a rack that holds lances, shields, and other knightly arms._

Destran is not a vampire and has no real need of a crypt. However, Tyriana insists on granting him a place of honor at her side. The **death knight** keeps his equipment in this chamber, but is seldom there. The sarcophagus contains an elaborate coffin of polished walnut, decorated with carvings and gold-leaf, but it is empty.

Some of the armor and weapons on the rack are trophies Destran keeps as mementos of particularly worthy challengers. Among these are several magical items:

* A +2 large shield of dwarven make

### SU6.4 False Crypt

_The marble doors open on a vaulted crypt-chamber lined on either side by columns of rose marble. In the center of the chamber lies a sarcophagus of marble somewhat smaller than the one in the chamber off the hallway. A red cloth embroidered in a briar motif stretches across the length of the sarcophagus. In it is a spray of fresh, blood-red roses. At the rear of the chamber a tapestry depicts a black-haired elven maid who proffers a sword, hilt-first, in her left hand._

This is a false crypt chamber meant as a decoy to mislead would-be assassins or tomb-raiders. The section of wall behind the tapestry is a secret door that leads to Tyriana’s real crypt. The sarcophagus contains a black wooden coffin, lined with satin, which contains a shovelful of ordinary dirt.

### SU6.5 Tyriana's Crypt

_The doors open on a crypt-chamber in the style of the tombs of the lords of the Dharovin. In the center of a high-domed chamber of light grey marble, stands a sarcophagus of rose quartz sculpted in the elegant lines typical of elven design. Its lid is carved with a life-size likeness of Tyriana herself, depicted in repose and holding a rose to her bosom. Side-chambers hold three lesser sarcophagi of white marble. The wall behind each is adorned with a tapestry, the central feature of which is a maiden who stands holding a blood-red rose in similar fashion to the figure on the main sarcophagus. On each side of these smaller sarcophagi and on each side of the doorway crouch statues of winged panthers carved from black jade. Their alert faces have unsettlingly human features._

This is Tyriana’s crypt chamber. She will only be present here if the adventurers reduced her to zero hit points in a previous encounter, in which case she will have reformed inside her coffin. However, Tyriana’s handmaidens, three **vampire spawn fey** (nymphs), are generally resting in the smaller sarcophagi, from which they will rise to defend the chamber from interlopers.

The statues are magical and afford Tyriana and her handmaidens the following lair actions (only one vampire may use this lair action in each round). Each statue has armor class X and takes X hit points to destroy.

#### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing ties) the vampire takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* A bolt of crackling necrotic energy shoots in a line between two opposing states (the vampire chooses which pair). Living creatures within 5 feet of the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A living creature takes 16 (4d8) damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The lost hit points are divided equally among the undead creatures within 5 feet of the line, each of which regains the indicated number of hit points.
* A wall of darkness 5 feet thick and 10 feet high arises between each opposing pair of statues. The darkness totally obscures its area and anything beyond it. The darkness immediately extinguishes normal light sources in its area and cannot be penetrated by magical light from a spell of 3rd level or less. Each creature in the area of darkness when it appears or that starts its turn there must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded unit the end of its next turn. The darkness lasts until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.
* The statues each emit an aura of unholiness in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the statue. Undead creatures in the area of effect are immune to radiant damage and the effects of radiant damage or a cleric’s turn undead feature on such creatures are immediately cancelled. The aura lasts until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.

The lid of Tyriana’s sarcophagus may be opened with a successful DC 16 Strength check. Inside the sarcophagus is a coffin of pale beechwood inlaid in ivory and platinum and lined with white silk. If the coffin is removed, it will reveal a hollow in the floor in which lies a shovelful of sandy soil — dirt from the spot where Tyriana passed into undeath.

## SU7: Chamber of the Dark Crystal

By Gothrog’s command, the necrotic energies unleashed in this place are being channeled into huge crystals of black _necrotite_, a mineral that is found only in cysts formed by intraplanar inclusions of the plane of Shadow in the deeps of the Underdark. The Iron Tyrant plans to use the charged crystals to power devastating weapons for use in his war against elvenkind.

### SU7.1 Crystal Chamber

_The dark staircase winds up and up in a spiral around a massive central column. After many turns, you begin to hear sporadic snapping, crackling, and popping sounds from above. As you ascend higher, these sounds grow louder. Moreover, a faint stench of decay rises in your nostrils. The darkness gives way to irregular flashes of a dim light that somehow seems only to make the shadows deeper._

_The stairs end in a domed cupola. Through an open doorway you can see two granite columns that stand before a domed alcove in a curved wall. Within the alcove is a gray marble basin that seems to be filled with some sort of liquid. The chamber is lit with the same dim light, but the flashes are more intense. The popping noises, coincide with the flashes of light and the odor seems to intensify after particularly sustained bursts. You begin to feel vaguely ill._

_When you emerge into the circular chamber, you can see that the flickering light emits from an oculus at the apex of the domed ceiling. The oculus opens into a tall cupola. In the center of the cupola dome, an enormous, blue-black crystal crackles and flashes with sparks of bluish purple lightning. Just watching the unnatural energy arc from the crystal to narrow apertures in the walls of the cupola makes the gorge rise in your throat._

A **duergar artificer** named Unrad and his three **duergar** assistants are charged to watch over the charging of the necrotite crystals. Except for their size, the duergar aren’t recognizable as dwarves because of their gear, which is designed to protect them from the ambient necrotic energy in this place. They wear heavy, black cloth armor quilted with a layer of cloth woven of lead-impregnated threads. Their full-face helmets are lined with the same material and feature round lead-glass eye-coverings. The duergar also wear leather boots and gauntlets lined with lead cloth. Unrad and his assistants are armed only with the knives and small hammers they carry on their utility belts, but the artificer scarcely has need of arms, since he wears the control amulet for the **iron golem** that guards the chamber and does the heavy lifting.

Unless they have reason to be alarmed, the duregar and the golem will be on the opposite side of the chamber from the entrance, carefully packing a fully-charged necrotite crystal into a wooden crate filled with wood shavings. If the adventurers are stealthy, it will be entirely possible to catch the artificer and his assistants by surprise. If he is able, Unrad will order the golem to attack and will then turn invisible. His assistants will follow suit and all will try to steal away to make their escape by the stairs. In extremis, Unrad will hold a hammer above the partially-packed crystal and threaten to shatter it unless the adventurers back off. However, the artificer can be open to negotiation, particularly if he can be convinced that Tyriana and Destran have been defeated.

A necrotite crystal is 16-18 inches wide, 5-7 feet long, and can hold 30 charges. Each crystal is AC 13, has 7 (2d6) hit points, is resistant to fire, cold, and lightning damage, but is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage dealt by hard objects such as stones or hammers. If the crystal cracks or shatters, it will release any necrotic energy it stores in a sphere with a radius of 60 feet centered on the crystal. Any creature in this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage for each charge the crystal holds, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The basin holds no liquid, but instead is set with a round pane of black glass ringed with a circle of glowing white dwarf-runes. This is actually a magical control panel for a _levitation field_ that extends from the top of the cupola covering the stairs to the apex of the cupola covering the oculus at the apex of the dome. By means of hand gestures made over the control panel, the duergar can raise a crystal up within the oculus and then open apertures in the cupola that expose it to the energies of the vortex. When the crystal is charged, the duergar can lower it so that the golem can lift it out of the field to be crated up and sent off to Gothrog’s armories. The gestures used with the control panel are:

| Gesture | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| Circle hand counter-clockwise | Raise object within the levitation field |
| Circle hand clockwise | Lower object within the levitation field |
| Spread fingers | Open apertures |
| Close fist | Close apertures |
| Tap glass with palm | Turn levitation field on/off |

The runes give no instructions in these effects, but rather affix the spells that cause the effects. Large number runes appear in the center of the panel when a crystal is charging and indicate (0-30) the level of change that the crystal holds. A crystal exposed to the vortex recharges at the rate of 3 (1d6) charges per 24 hours. A crystal can be overcharged, but each charge over 30 brings a cumulative 10% chance that the crystal will explode.
