# Blackfane Spire - Lower Levels

### Encounter SL1: The Bridge of Stars

From the landing on the inside of Blackfane Ring, the adventurer are faced with an intimidating vista:

_Cocooned within the violence of the maelstrom, the spire soars to a towering height above you and plummets to a dizzying depth below. It is difficult to see clearly through the swirling vapors so perhaps your view is distorted. The architecture of the spire seems almost elvish in its elegance, but at the same time, it is bizarre and unsettling. Slender, sharp-pointed turrets and spike-railed balconies jut out in unexpected places and the shiny black stone is carved with many projections and convolutions. Slitted, high-arched windows pierce the walls in irregular positions. Almost it would seem that the spire was not so much crafted as grown._

_A bridge of black onyx extends through the maelstrom to an abutment built in to the side of the spire, The bridge is wide enough for two men to walk abreast. Its glassy surface dimly reflects the stars, even though the sky is perpetually overcast. The winds of the maelstrom threaten to sweep you away even from the landing where you stand. However, the bridge runs through what looks like a tunnel of calm that extends through the vortex. The tunnel extends 10 feet above and below the surface of the bridge and comes no nearer than 5 feet from its edge. It still seems perilous, though, because the bridge lacks even the hint of a rail._

The only sure means to reach the spire is by the bridge. See The Vortex under General Features for rules pertaining to attempts to cross the vortex.

The bridge is 10 feet wide and 450 feet long. Its entire length is affected by ethereal tunnel that extends in a 10-foot radius above and below its center. The enchanted bridge allows creatures to cross to the spire safe from the ill effects of the maelstrom, but there are other perils here.

### Encounter SL2: The Sentinel

_You find yourself alone on the bridge, which stretches before you like a ribbon of night sky studded with bright stars. It pierces the maelstrom as though it were a road through a tunnel. As you advance, you can see that ahead stands a fell figure -- a knight astride a powerful black horse with a mane and tail that blaze with fire. Both horse and rider are armored in ornate, but outmoded, black plate armor and their eyes burn like glowing coals from visor and chanfron. The knight levels his long lance, hefts his mighty shield, and in a voice terrible and chill demands, “What do you here, mortal(s) and in whose name do you come?”_

The rider is Destran, a death knight bonded to Tyriana as her bodyguard. Destran challenges all who seek to cross the bridge and woe to him who cannot give a satisfactory account of his business with the Spire.

As an anti-paladin, Destran is under no obligation to give a fair fight. There is a trapdoor at the midpoint of the bridge and the death knight will first challenge the party from a distance of 120 feet when they first reach that point. The trapdoor consists of two sections, each 15 feet long, on pivots 5 feet from either end. The trapdoor opens from the middle and swings down. It opens rather slowly, as it is counterbalanced and geared to allow it to be easily reset. Creatures on the trapdoor when it is triggered must make a Dexterity saving throw or be left clinging to the trapdoor. Creatures on the 5 feet of the trapdoor section nearest the bridge make a DC 5 saving throw, while characters on the other 5 foot sections make DC 8 or DC 10 saving throws, respectively. Most creatures will take the shortest path to safety, but player characters may elect to cross the gap as the trapdoor opens. Those who so choose must be able to jump the distance and must save at DC 15, DC 20, or DC 25 in each successive 5 feet of the section. Characters in the very last 5 feet of the opposite section are able to jump 5 feet farther than normal, as they can take advantage of the momentum from the swing. Creatures clinging to the trapdoor are considered to be incapacitated and must make a second DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be dumped into the chasm and swept away by the vortex.

The purpose of the trapdoor is not so much to dispose of foes outright as to split their party. Destran will attempt to draw the party’s strongest fighters forward with his challenges before he charges. As he rides forward, he will dip his lance to flip a lever that springs the trapdoor so that the fighters are likely to be separated from the others. If he succeeds in this, the death knight will ride his steed ethereally to the other side of the bridge and attack the rest of the party from the rear. Otherwise, he will simply continue his charge headlong into whatever portion of the party ends up on the near side.

Destran can never be truly destroyed, save by fulfillment of his curse. Unless that comes to pass, he will always be available to heed Tyriana's summons as well as guard the bridge.

### Encounter SL3: The Catacombs of the Spawn - Entrance Level

The bridge ends in a landing before an open archway into the spire, from which emanates an eerie greenish-yellow light.

_You step off the bridge onto the landing. The vortex howls just behind you. Before you, a tall lancet archway supported by columns on either hand pierces the glossy black stone. From the archway spills an unwholesome, greenish-yellow light . Beyond the archway, a colonnaded gallery opens on a large, dark interior space. The light comes from torches set in sconces at intervals along the wall, but it is a dim, uncertain light that only deepens the shadows and does nothing to illuminate the interior._

When the characters enter the Spire through the archway, they will find that the gallery is circular and extends all the way around the interior. If they shine a bright light into the interior space, it will be apparent that below this gallery are other galleries stacked tier upon tier, descending into darkness. Above the entrance-level gallery is a wall that rings the interior space. This wall is painted with a mural depicting thin, pale women with elvish features dancing beneath a twilight sky. Above the wall is a high dome ridged in an intricate lattice-pattern that could be called classical elven architecture were it not for the bizarre and somehow sinister character of the design.

The Catacombs were excavated to house Tyriana's army of **vampire spawn**. There are nine gallery levels. The walls of each are honeycombed with burial vaults, 48 in all on each level.  Most are empty, especially on the lower levels, but many contain a wooden coffin. The coffins are all alike -- new, and of good, but simple craftsmanship. The vampire spawn to whom the coffins belong are mostly away doing Tyriana's bidding, but there is a chance that any given coffin will be occupied (see the table below). The occupants are sleeping the sleep of the dead and will not wake unless their coffins are disturbed or they are awakened by another of the spire's denizens.

| Level | d20 Roll |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1-3   | 1-20 = Crypt contains a coffin (roll on table below) |
| 4-6   | 1-10 = Crypt contains a coffin (roll on table below) |
| 7-9   | 1-5 = Crypt contains a coffin (roll on table below) |

| d20 Roll | Occupant |
| -------- | -------- |
| 1-10     | Away |
| 11-15    | Vampire spawn |
| 16-18    | Vampire spawn warrior |
| 19       | Vampire spawn spellcaster |
| 20       | Vampire spawn fey |

Opposite the entrance, a stairway descends to another gallery below and a second stair ascends to the level above. On the wall between the stairways hangs an elaborate tapestry depicting an elven woman with long silver hair who holds a long-stemmed, red rose to her bosom with one thin, pale hand. With the other hand, she lifts the hem of her white gown to reveal bare feet that tread painstakingly-embroidered blades of grass. Her glance is downward and deep sorrow lies on her countenance. Such is the craftsmanship and detail of the tapestry that a close inspection will reveal that the thorns of the rose are tinged with red. Red droplets worked in shiny silken thread stain the woman's hand and bodice.

Tyriana trusts to the strength of her outer defenses and so does not keep a watch within the spire. However, two female vampire spawn are abroad in the gallery. They will be located in a random (1d8) sector and will rush to attack a lone adventurer. If they are outnumbered, they will retreat to the lower gallery to gather reinforcements.

### Encounter SL4: The Catacombs of the Spawn - Lower Levels

There are a total of nine galleries in the catacombs, including the entrance level. Each is almost identical to the entrance level, except for the lack of an archway and the position of the stairs, which wind around the inside wall of the spire. A tapestry on the wall between the flights of steps on each level depicts a different scene in the story of Tyriana's fall into evil and undeath. The tapestries are wonderfully worked with threads of silver and gold and set here and there with precious stones.

* The elf-maiden dances in an elegant garden and is wooed by a handsome mortal knight.
* The maiden gives the knight a white gem as he embraces her. In the background, a group of elves looks on in sorrow.
* The elf woman smiles on a girl-child in a cradle. Through a window, the knight is seen in the distance on horseback with drawn sword, riding down a pack of fleeing orcs.
* The elf woman tends a garden while two girl-children with curly platinum hair chase dragonflies near a pond. Beyond the wall of the garden, the knight dallies with a dark-haired mortal maid.
* The knight and dark-haired maid stand holding hands while the elf-woman swoons in grief at their feet. The maid looks away, but the knight levels a cold gaze at the elf-woman and points away to the distance in a gesture of rejection.
* The elf-woman bends over a book-stand to trace her finger across a page filled with strange symbols and arcane script. She stands within a circle drawn in white on the gray flagstone floor. Outside the circle, a tall, square-shouldered man, cloaked and hooded in black, stands arms akimbo with his back to the viewer. A character who makes a successful Perception (Wisdom) DC 14 check will notice that the man's nearer hand is visible beneath his brocaded sleeve and that it is red with long, sharp black nails.
* The knight is held immobile by tendrils of briar. He tries to turn his face away, but his gaze is fixed on the elf-woman, who forces the maid's head back by a handful of her dark hair as she draws a dagger across her throat. The girl-children lie in a pool of blood at her bare feet. A character who makes a successful Perception (Wisdom) DC 18 check will notice a handsome man's face beneath a hood cunningly worked in black embroidered stitches on the black background of the shadows in an alcove.
* The elf-woman, now gaunt and ragged, lies supine on a barren plain with high, sharp-peaked mountains in the background. Her open hands are stained reddish brown and turned palms upward in the repose of death. Her face too bears the death's pallor, but a successful Perception (Wisdom) DC 16 check will reveal that her half-lidded eyes glow red and that the top row of teeth visible between her parted lips features long, sharp canines.

The ninth and lowest tier is not a gallery. Its interior archways have no balustrade, but instead open on a central court. At the center of the court, a circular shaft descends 50 feet to the Pit.

The following denizens are abroad on the galleries:

| Level | Denizens Awake | Denizens in Crypts |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1     | 2 vampire spawn | 7 vampire spawn |
| | | 8 vampire spawn warrior |
| | | 1 vampire spawn spellcaster |
| | | 5 vampire spawn fey |
| 2     | none           | 9 vampire spawn |
| | | 10 vampire spawn warrior |
| | | 3 vampire spawn fey |
| 3     | none           | 10 vampire spawn |
| | | 4 vampire spawn warrior |
| | | 3 vampire spawn spellcaster |
| | | 5 vampire spawn fey |
| 4     | none           | 4 vampire spawn |
| | | 3 vampire spawn warrior |
| | | 1 vampire spawn spellcaster |
| 5     | none           | 4 vampire spawn |
| | | 6 vampire spawn warrior |
| | | 3 vampire spawn spellcaster |
| 6     | vampire        | 3 vampire spawn |
| | | 5 vampire spawn warrior |
| | | 2 vampire spawn spellcaster |
| | | 2 vampire spawn fey |
| 7     | none           | 2 vampire spawn |
| | | 3 vampire spawn warrior |
| | | 2 vampire spawn fey |
| 8     |vampire spawn warrior | 2 vampire spawn |
| | vampire spawn spellcaster | 3 vampire spawn warrior |
| | | 1 vampire spawn spellcaster |
| | | 1 vampire spawn fey |
| 9     | none           | 3 vampire spawn |
| | | 3 vampire spawn warrior |

Sounds carry easily within the interior space. Any loud noises will be detected by denizens abroad on the lower levels, who may investigate or wake others, depending on their perception of the situation. This means that the party need not face the entire strength of the catacombs at once, if at all, but once a general alarm is raised, the adventurers could quickly find themselves facing an overwhelming number of dangerous foes.

### Encounter SL5: The Black Pit

_A deep natural cavern lies below the galleries. At its apex, 120 feet from the general level of the floor, it is only 60 feet across, but at the base it is much wider. The floor is broken by deep fissures into sections that are at various levels. Crude ladders and bridges connect the sections so that it is possible to traverse from one side of the cavern to the other. Thousands of bats roost on the ceiling and the air is filled with the flapping of their leathery wings. Yet, the air is wholesome, not stale, and the floor is clear of debris._

A warren of smaller caverns join the main cavern at various levels. They are the dwellings of over 200 thoroughly miserable **commoner** slaves -- men, women, and children who are kept like cattle for the denizens of the spire to feed from. They are afforded considerably more than the bare essentials needed for survival because the vampires want them to replenish their blood quickly. The vampires regularly lower water, food, and fuel for the small braziers that provide light and heat for the caves and niches. Even basic sanitation is available by means of six **gelatinous cubes** that patrol the sections of the main cavern. However, imprisonment here is a death sentence. Weakened by blood loss, disease, and the chill, damp air, most prisoners survive only a few months. The vampires constantly bring in new captives and feed the casualties to the cubes.

Twelve **giant bats** make their roosts on the ceiling. A random number of them (1d6) will swoop to attack any creature larger than tiny that flies anywhere in the cavern. The **vampire spawn** come here to feed as well so there is a chance that a small group of them will be spider-climbing on the walls or ceiling of the cavern at any given time (1d20, 1-5 = 1d6 vampire spawn).

The inmates of the pits have learned the survival skills necessary to cope with the perils of the cavern in order to claim the supplies that the vampires lower. Some twenty have martial training of one sort or another, but the lack of magical weapons renders them helpless against the predations of the vampires. They congregate into small bands divided by culture and language, for the vampires take captives from a variety of sources to avoid notice and to make an uprising among their "cattle" less likely.
