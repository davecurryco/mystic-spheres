# History of the Azruun Empire

## Rise and Fall

The Azruun were a race of humans corrupted by contact with the Shadowfell in their quest for arcane power. Originating on the east coast of what is now Beranur, the Azruun drove the dwarves of Kazgad into the western mountains and conquered Hannesh. Expanding their dominion south and west, they allied with barbarian tribes to overthrow the Kingdom of Ophar and the Old Kingdom. Tribute flowed from these vassal states to Xandul, the City of Sorcery, on the Eastern Sea.

Azruun tyranny lasted less than a hundred and fifty years. Finding his northward expansion checked by the Kindom of Asarial The witch-king Narastur built a fortress in the badlands of northern Dhoar and waged war with the elves. After seven years of siege, the elven child-sorceress Lianniel, an incarnation of Dialiannon the Eternal, met Narastur and his Circle of Seven in an arcane battle before the gates of the City of Asarial. In this titanic struggle, both Narastur and Lianniel were destroyed and an unintended release of unfettered elemental power led to a cataclysm that sank Xandul beneath the waters and laid waste to the city of Asarial and all the country around it.

## Civilization

As wizards the Azruun ruling class were highly literate and as conquerers they recognized the value of written records for the administration of their empire. They did not, however, commission works of literature, as they were preoccupied with the pursuit of arcane power for the sake of personal ambition. Consequently, the surviving record of the Azruun ascendency is concerned mostly with self-aggrandizing historical accounts and mundane details of governance, taxation and campaign logistics.

The Azruun worshipped no gods but themselves, but they had pacts and alliances with powerful beings from the infernal and shadow spheres. Fearing perhaps the judgment that awaits the dead, they developed rituals to bind their spirits to the world as long as their bodies should last. Embalmed and entombed after death, many lingered in the world as wraiths and wights, while some found a living embalmment in lich-hood. They sought thus to preserve their mortal existence indefinitely in the hope of eventual resurrection, perhaps in service to a great witch-king as foretold in the prophecies of their race.
