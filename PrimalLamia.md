**Innate Spellcasting.** The primal lamia’s innate spell casting ability is Charisma (Spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). The lamia can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _detect magic, dispel magic, enthrall, major image, shield_  
3/day each: _counterspell, dominate monster, hypnotic pattern, moonbeam, scrying_  
1/day each: _feeblemind, mass suggestion, sanctuary_  

**Distracting Presence (True Form Only).** Each male human within 15 feet of the primal lamia makes attack rolls against the lamia at disadvantage.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the primal lamia fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The primal lamia has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** The primal lamia regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes necrotic damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. The primal lamia dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Shapechanger.** The primal lamia can use her action to polymorph into a Small or Medium female humanoid of any appearance, a Large snake, or back into her true form. Her statistics, other than her size, are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying is also transformed.

**Wakeful.** The primal lamia is always awake.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The primal lamia makes two bite attacks or two claw attacks.

**Bite (Snake Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d4 + 8) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) poison damage.

**Biting Word (True or Humanoid Form Only) (Recharge 5-6).** The primal lamia utters a venomous word of power. Each creature within 30 feet of her that isn't a fiend must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 27 (5d10) psychic damage, drop whatever it is holding, and become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the primal lamia by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the primal lamia, the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

**Claw (True Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points, and it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a save.

**Enthralling Gaze.** The lamia targets one humanoid that she can see within 60 feet of her. If the target can see the lamia, it must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the lamia as a divine being worthy of worship and devotion. Although the target isn’t under the lamia’s control, it takes the lamia’s requests of actions as commands to be unhesitatingly obeyed.
Each time the lamia or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the lamia is on a different plane of existence from the target, or the lamia ends the effect as a bonus action. If the target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the lamia’s Enthralling Gaze for the next 24 hours.
The lamia can have no more than three humanoids charmed at a time.

**Sensuous Touch (True Form Only).** _Melee Spell Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of the lamia's next turn. Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, the target is magically cursed for 24 hours. Until the curse ends, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and all ability checks.

**Teleport.** The primal lamia magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.

## Reactions

**Protective Thrall.** When the primal lamia is hit by an attack, one creature within 5 feet of the primal lamia that is charmed by her must use its reaction to be hit by the attack instead.

---

## Legendary Actions

The primal lamia can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The primal lamia regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

**Flurry of Attacks (Costs 2 Actions).** The primal lamia makes a bite or claw attack agains each creature within 10 feet of her.

**Detect Thoughts.** The primal lamia reads the thoughts of a creature she can see, as per the _Detect Thoughts_ spell with a spell save DC of 23.

**Teleport.** The primal lamia uses her Teleport action.

## A Primal Lamia's Lair

A primal lamia's typically chooses some long-abandoned ruin in some out-of-the-way location as a lair and covers it with glamours to make it appear to be a luxurious abode.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing ties) the primal lamia takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the primal lamia can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* The primal lamia creates fog as though she had cast the _fog cloud_ spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. The primal lamia and creatures of her choice that she can see when she causes this effect can see normally in the fog.  
* The primal lamia glimpses the future, so she has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.

### Regional Effects

The region surrounding a primal lamia's lair is transformed by her will, creating one or more of the following effects:

* The terrain within 1 mile of the lair and the interior of the lair itself is affected by a permanent _mirage arcane_, assuming whatever form the primal lamia wishes.  
* Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Common while within 1 mile of the primal lamia's lair. These creatures speak fearfully of the primal lamia, but can't divulge her whereabouts. To the best of their abilities, they will attempt to inform the primal lamia of any contact with strangers.
* Within its lair, the primal lamia can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, and illusory visual effects, such as soft mists or glittering dust, so that they affect various parts of the lair.

**Primal Lamias** were beautiful women given by the gods as wives to the first human men. In their vanity and pride, the women rebelled against the gods and suffered a terrible downfall -- banished by their husbands and cursed by the gods. The women were transformed into the primal lamias, demons in ageless human flesh bound to the Material Plane and compelled to consume children for their sustenance.
