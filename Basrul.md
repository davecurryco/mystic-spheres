# Basrul

Basrul is a beautiful city of red-tiled buildings and slender towers at the head of the blue waters of Makkarresh Bay.

## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Kritarchy

Basrul is governed by a board of judges, the _Yasheem_, a remnant of a theocracy that ruled the city-state centuries ago. Today, the Yasheem enforces secular law according to precedents handed down over generations. As a result, there are laws governing even the most trivial aspects of everyday life, some of which carry draconian penalties. A hereditary caste of executioners, the _Rashteer_ enforces the law under the authority of the Yasheem, often exercising summary judgement on lawbreakers and meting out punishment on the spot.


## Religion

**Majority Religion:** Panthiestic

The people of Basrul subscribe to the notion that the gods are too distant to be concerned with the lives of mortals. Accordingly, they worship a pantheon of demigods, most of them mortals who ascended to immortality because of great deeds, good works, or accumulation of power that earned them veneration or supplication. These _Dheyja_ often do take an active interest in the affairs of the city, for good or ill.
