# Guardians of the Scepter

The _Guardians of the Scepter_ is a royal society formed as a cover organization for a secret alliance of noble families, powerful financiers and wealthy merchants supporting Caladron the Despised in his usurpation of the rule of Essealona. Although Caladron himself was deposed, the Order remained generally intact. Its members bide their time and plot intricate schemes against the day when King Allenar III will be declared legally dead and the throne will be up for grabs.
