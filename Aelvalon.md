# Aelvalon (The Feywild)

The equivalent of the Feywild, this parallel plane is a joint construct of the Angeanni Avalon and Shangri-la that was invaded by viral constructs created by Xanadu and Cimmeria.

Aelvalon resembles the natural world and mirrors its physics and geography, but as they were when the world was young. Aelvalon does not share the same time continuum with the world outside. Each day in Aelvalon is as 1-6 weeks in the mortal world.

Aelvalon is divided into several realms, each of which is dominated by the construct of a particular Angeanni and so has a different character.

# Realms of Aelvalon

## Aulurinnya

_The Fair Realm, Elfland (Avalon)_

The Fair Realm is a place of goodness and light, where nature shines forth in summer glory under a bright sun. It is a land of pleasant groves, summer meadows, babbling brooks and majestic mountains. It is also home to fantastic landscapes such as the Crystal Forest and the Mirror Lake. Celiannor, the King of Aelvalon, rules here in the pristine splendor of Elyeanesse, the Pristine City, attended by an illustrious court of high-ranking Illuvarin. His wife, Queen Fioryessa reigns by his side.

### Rulers

[[CeliannorKingOfTheFairRealm]]

Titled the King of Aelvalon, Celiannor is a mortal Illuvarin who gained enough power and arcane lore to achieve a sort of immortality. His will and the disposition of the Fair Realm are essentially the same and he has broad influence over the other realms as well.

Celiannor appears as an Aelvii male of exceptional height and handsomeness. A circlet of stars wreathes his brow over his long white hair and the gleam of starlight is in his violet eyes. He usually wears blue robes of richly-patterened silk and carries the Scepter of the Spheres, an Aelvii artifact of great power.

[[FioryessaQueenOfTheFairRealm]]

The Queen of Aelvalon is a mortal Illuvarin elevated by Celiannor to rule alongside him. She is a match for her husband in beauty and stature. She is a patron of the arts and is the master of the Harp of the Spheres, an instrument that resonates with the tales of the Illuvarin race -- past, present and future.  A filagree of liquid gold encircles her golden hair and her eyes blaze with the brilliance of sapphires. She wears gowns of white gossamer spun from crystal that flash and sparkle in her radiance.


## Cymmyrion

_The Shadow Realm, Blightland (Cimmeria)_

The Shadow Realm is a twisted place of darkness and cold, where the cruelty and decay inherent in nature holds all the land in a relentless grip. Its mountains are jagged and practically impassible, its streams roar with the rage of ice-cold water and it is riddled with fetid bogs and howling wastes. Gothrog the Tyrant, the Great Warlord of the Fomorians rules here from the fastness of the Iron Tower of Carcrae, a many-spired fortress in an enormous underground cavern. Hags, goblins, trolls and other wicked creatures hold sway over various corners of the Dark Realm and plot to usurp Gothrog's throne.

### Rulers

[[GothrogTheTyrant]]

Dubbed "The Tyrant", Gothrog is both an immensely mighty warrior and a terrifyingly powerful sorcerer. His reach is long and his whims are as life and death to any within the grasp of his power.

Gothrog is Fomorian giant of enormous stature. He wears piecemeal armor, but each piece is an enchanted masterwork stolen or plundered from some other plane. He wields Dogrash, the DarkHammer, a fearsome weapon of shadow and flame.


## Essaemyrynmaere

_The Midnight Sea_

The sun never shines over the cold, black sea north of Cymmyrion. The surface of the dark water is usually mirror-smooth, reflecting the myriad stars overhead. Indeed, ships that sail north on this sea will eventually launch out on the trackless distances of space. The dreams of mortals swim the currents of the Midnight Sea in great shoals. Morgwynn, the Witch of the Midnight Sea, rules here, as much as any being can hold sway over such vastness.

## Essaevaeynmaere

_The Gray Sea_

Gray-green waves break in monotonous rhythm on the shale-sand beaches of the east coast of Cymmyrion under perpetually overcast skies. Mists cling to the shore and thicken into a dense fog only a few miles out onto the Gray Sea. The memories of mortals drift ghostlike among the mists. It is said that far east over the ocean, the mists roll back as a curtain to a swift sunrise over a green shore, but none have ever returned from thence to vouch for it.

## Essayenwe

_The Sundering Sea_

The sea that separates the mortal world from Aelvalon is trackless and unfathomable. Great billows roll on its bright blue waters, reflecting the brilliant blue sky above. However, by the will of the rulers of Aelvalon, the Sundering Sea can become dark and tempestous.

### Rulers

[[DasDanna]]

The King of Waters personifies the relentless character of water rushing downhill to join with the sea and the vast, unpredictable power of the oceans. He appears as a young, male Illuvarin with pale hair and sea-green eyes that never seem still. His mercurial nature and relentless drive make him a dangerous foe, particularly since he can command rivers to alter their course and the seas to roil in great tidal waves. The creatures of the lakes and the deeps obey his orders as well.

## Evenesse

_The Starlit Realm, Starbright (Xanadu)_

The Starlit Realm is a land of eternal twilight, where the enchanting but distant character of a starry night holds sway. It is filled with moonlit lakes, shadowed glens, and grassy downs beneath the myriad stars. Seleannona, the Lady of the Stars holds court in a majestic pavilion that is magically raised in a different woodland meadow each "night". She is attended by a court that includes faerie folk such as pixies and gnomes as well as Illuvarin.

### Rulers

[[SeleannonaLadyOfStars]]

Unlike Celiannor and his lady, the Lady of Stars is not an elevated mortal, but an incarnation of Dialiannon the Eternal.

Seleanonna appears as an Illuvarin woman of unearthly beauty and majestic poise. Her simple gown is woven from strands of moonlight and her mithril crown is set with seven gems in each which is captured the light of a guiding star. This is the Crown of Stars, an Aelvii artifact that grants its wearer knowledge of anything visible under the sky. By this power, Seleannona drove Gothrog and his Fomorians underground, a defeat for which they hold a special grudge.


## Faelyon

_The Greenwood Realm, Deepwood (Shangri-la)_

The Greenwood Realm is the archetype of all forests and is the wellspring of all that is wild and untouched. All the manifestations of wilderness are found here, from deep primeval forest to alpine meadows. Forloth Firlongin, an powerful and immortal treant, ranges here in eternal guardianship of Laessedomon, the Firstroot, an impossibly gargantuan and ancient tree. This realm is also the home of many wood-nymphs, satyrs, centaurs and other woodland fey creatures who pay allegiance to Dryannia, Lady of the Wood. The Greenwood Realm also extends to the sea, where Das Danna, King of Waters, rules over a court of sea elves, water-nymphs, mermen and mermaids.

### Rulers

[[ForlothFirlongin]]

The firstborn of the treants, Forloth's might is great and his memory is vast. He towers over normal treants as a giant redwood towers over even the largest of oaks. As strong as he is, Forloth is most to be feared for this ability to draw on the animate and command the plant-life wherever he may be in the Greenwood Realm.

[[DryanniaLadyOfTheWood]]

The Lady of the Wood is a fey spirit, a physical manifestation of the entire Greenwood Realm in the same way that a dryad is a manifestation of the spirit of an individual tree. She usually takes the form of a beautiful nymph aged to ripe womanhood. Like her peer rulers  of the Greenwood Realm, Dryannia's personal power is not so great as her ability to draw on the aid of the animals within the domain.

[[Laessedomon]]

The Firstroot is an sentient being within the Aelvalon construct, although its intelligence is incomprehensible to most humanoids. Its roots extend beneath the mountains of Aelvalon to the Elemental Chaos and its highest branches extend to the Astral Plane. From these sources, it channels primal power to Aelvalon.

Just as some types of trees send out runners, so Laessodomon extends its being through offshoots. Wherever a sapling of the Firstroot is planted, a channel to the Deepwood opens, watched by the great tree's ancient intelligence.
