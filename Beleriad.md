_The Golden Sunrise_

**Captain:** Ceanalor son of Enear  
**First Mate:** Danron son of Tealor

A merchant cog registered in Telenarion, the Sunrise transports merchants and their goods between Telenarion and Beleriad.

Ceanalor is a portly man in his forties. The skin of his bald head is weathered above the fringe of his graying blond hair. He wears a full beard that has begun to gray as well. Although he has many seasons as captain aboard various merchant vessels, Ceanalor is not a particularly apt seaman. His primary qualification as a captain is his reputation for being plain-spoken and fair-dealing.

Danron is in his late twenties. He is squat, but strong and is covered in black hair. The crew calls him "Ape" behind his back, but his skill as a brawler is such that none of them dares say it to his face. Danron is furtively contemptuous of Ceanalor, who he considers a sub-par captain. In a crisis, he might resort to mutiny.

### Governor's Keep Quarter

#### Inns and Taverns

_Call to Arms Inn_

**Proprieter:** Generon son of Anloron.

A two-story inn with a large central hall popular with the soldiers of the garrison. This inn features extended-stay suites that are often rented by army officers sent from Telenarion.

Generon is a former army commander who bought the inn from the wastrel son of its founder. Although he is in his early sixties, Generon's upright bearing, close-cropped white hair and burly physique mark him as a military man. His wife is dead, but his two adult daughters, Selaonia and Telaeria, help him run the inn. A champion boxer in his day, Generon is quick to avenge any insult to their honor and the soldiers who frequent the Call respect this.
