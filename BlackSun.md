# The Black Sun

  A secret organization of assassins and dark sorcerers headed by a mysterious figure titled, "Grandfather Tiger". The Black Sun was originally organized and funded by Rashazer to destabilize the governments of Pashan. Thus, the philosophy and symbology of the organization has a decidedly Azruun cast. However, the current Grandfather Tiger, an exceptionally-intelligent **rakshasa** named Ramaal, is more interested in the pursuit of wealth and power than in doing the bidding of a remote master. Under Ramal's leadership, Black Sun assassins frequently undertake missions for the highest bidder -- regardless of how this affects Rashazer's strategic goals in the region.
  
Assassins of The Black Sun are mostly recruited from the merchant and tradesman classes of the city-states of Pashan. They are trained in secret mountain camps and are sent back to their homes and occupations to be summoned as needed for nefarious missions. Initiates are marked with a chest-tattoo depicting an eclipsed sun, which is only visible when they are tasked with a mission for the organization.

An inner circle of evil sorcerers serves as Grandfather Tiger's top lieutenants and enforcers. These are all members of a mixed Ahlrain/Azruun bloodline tainted by inbreeding and long association with infernal powers. Many of them are deformed in body and all are at least a little insane.
