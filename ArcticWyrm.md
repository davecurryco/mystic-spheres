**Arctic Wyrms** are less-intelligent cousins of dragons that have adapted to life in the frigid lakes, rivers, and oceans of the far north. They resemble wingless white dragons, with webbed hind feet and with clawed flippers in place of forelimbs. On land, they slide on their bellies, propelled by their powerful hind legs, and they can also burrow through snow and ice. However, both these modes of movement are clumsy so arctic wyrms are almost never encountered more than a mile overland from water. When an arctic wyrm hunts for non-aquatic prey, it often burrows under deep snow or lurks beneath the ice of a frozen lake or river and suddenly bursts to the surface when its _tremorsense_ detects creatures above it.
