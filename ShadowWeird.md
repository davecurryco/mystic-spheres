**Amorphous.** The shadow weird can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The shadow weird can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Invisible in Shadow.** The shadow weird is invisible while fully cloaked by shadow. Because of the shadow weird's amorphous shape, the area of shadow sufficient for this effect can be quite thin (for example, the shadow beneath the lintel of a doorway).

**Sunlight Weakness.** While in sunlight, the shadow weird has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

## Actions

**Strength Drain** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

A **shadow weird** is a guardian from the demiplane of shadow bound to a specific location, such as a room or cavern.

**Neutral and Evil Weirds.** Like most elementals, a shadow weird has no concept of good or evil. However a shadow weird bound to a location permeated with ambient evil may take on the nature of the site, becoming neutral evil. A neutral evil shadow weird kills for pleasure and might turn against its summoner. 

**Elemental Nature.** A shadow weird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
