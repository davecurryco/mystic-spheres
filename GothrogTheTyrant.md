## Actions

**Multiattack.** Gothrog makes two dread scepter attacks (only one of which can use curse of the maiming strike).

**Dread Scepter.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 38 (6d6 + 16) bludgeoning damage and 15 (2d8 + 6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature of large size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Rock.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 35 (4d12 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

**Curse of the Maiming Strike.** When Gothrog hits a creature with a melee attack, as a bonus action, the fomorian can magically force the creature to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed with magical deformities in addition to the damage it suffers from the hit. While deformed, the creature has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attacks based on Strength or Dexterity.
The deformities Gothrog inflicts in this way are permanent unless cured by a _greater restoration_ or similar magic.

**Glare of Doom (3/day, Recharges after Short or Long Rest).** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +15 to hit, range 60 ft., one target that Gothrog can see. _Hit:_ 15 (2d8 + 6) fire damage and 27 (6d8) necrotic damage. If the target’s current hit point total is 100 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die.

## Legendary Actions

Gothrog can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Gothrog regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn. The effects of a legendary action last for the full duration without requiring concentration.

**Cantrip.** Gothrog casts a cantrip.

**Eye of Ill Fortune (Costs 2 Actions).** Gothrog places a curse on a creature he can see within range. For 1 minute thereafter, attacks that hit the target deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. Gothrog also chooses an ability when he uses this action. The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability. If the target rolls a Critical Failure on an ability check, saving throw, or attack, it suffers disadvantage on the results check.

**Baleful Eye (Costs 3 Actions).** Gothrog targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. If the target can see the fomorian, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gothrog can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects: the fomorian can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* A fissure opens in the ground starting from a point that Gothrog can see within 120 feet of him. The fissure may be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 60 feet deep, but must be straight for its entire length. Fumes and noxious vapors issue from the depths of the fissure and extend 10 feet above it, which area is lightly obscured. When the fissure appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save falls into the fissure and suffers the usual falling damage according to its depth. When a creature enters the fissure’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 10 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.
* Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that Gothrog can see within 120 feet of him. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success. The area in a 10 foot radius centered on the target becomes difficult terrain.
* A cloud of swarming umbral insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Gothrog chooses within 120 feet of him. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until Gothrog dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.

**Gothrog the Tyrant** is the absolute, unchallenged autocrat of the Fomorian giants who dwell in the vast caverns beneath the surface of Cymmyrion. He wears a suit of black plate armor forged of adamantium by the dark dwarves to conform to his gigantic, misshapen body and on his brow rests a heavy iron crown. From the slit beneath its heavy lid in the approximate center of his face, Gothrog's single, huge eye glowers red. The rest of his mottled, purplish head is a horror of misplaced features, great boils, and hairy warts. In his left hand, Gothrog wields the _Dread Scepter_, the symbol of his tyrannical rule and a fearsome weapon in its own right. When he is angered, the Tyrant wreaths himself in flames and fully opens his baleful eye to wreak woe on those who have incurred his wrath.
