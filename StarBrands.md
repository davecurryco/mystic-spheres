Only three _Star Brand_s were ever made, each forged by dwarven smiths and enchanted by elven magic to imbue their blades with the hard brilliance of the stars.

**Spells.** A _Star Brand_ allows a creature wielding it to cast a certain number of spells per day according to the particular star whose light it captures and the characteristics of its wielder. The spells do not require components and are treated as if cast by a ninth-level spell caster using a fifth level spell slot.

**Sentience.** Each _Star Brand_ is a sentient lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and dark vision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish, Elvish, and Common.
