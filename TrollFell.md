## Variant: Fell Troll Catapult

Some especially-huge fell trolls are trained to bear a light catapult into combat on their backs, complete with a crew of 6 goblins to operate it and two stones for ammunition. Catapult-bearing fell trolls are often accompanied by another fell troll that carries a supply of 10 stones. What this arrangement lacks in accuracy and range, it makes up for in mobility, although the trolls have a tendency to forget their burdens when enemies come within charging distance.

The catapult can hit targets behind cover. Before the catapult can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It takes two actions to load the weapon, two actions to aim it, and one action to fire it.

**Speed** 20 ft.

**Catapult Stone.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, range 150/600 ft. (can't hit targets with 60 feet of it), one target. _Hit:_ 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.
