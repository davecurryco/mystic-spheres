# Directed Reincarnation

_7th-level transmutation (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You touch a virgin female humanoid, willing or not, and call the soul of a target humanoid creature, no matter how long dead, to be reborn as a child within her womb. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

The infant will develop in the usual gestation time for the target creature's race. The mother will die in childbirth, which is essential to provide the magical energy needed to make the ritual permanent. The child will grow up with the race, personality, memories, and talents of the target creature and will come into full possession of that creature's capabilities by his or her thirteenth birthday.
