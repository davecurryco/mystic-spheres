**Shapechanger.** Once per turn, the weremuskrat can use its action to polymorph into a muskrat-humanoid hybrid or into a giant muskrat, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Keen Smell.** The weremuskrat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Weremuskrats** are reclusive creatures who dwell in dens dug into sandstone cliffs along riverbanks and ply the waters in rafts and coracles. In humanoid form, they are hairy, slack-jawed and almost childishly simple. They actually seem to gain cunning when in hybrid or muskrat form. Weremuskrat males wield flint daggers and are rather deadly with hurled stones, which which they are in constant practice from a young age. However, their preferred method of combat is to flee, generally into the water. For this reason, weremuskrats never venture far from the rivers along which they live.

Weremuskrat clans are ruled by a matriarch, typically the oldest female. They are social and cooperative among their own kind, but are extremely distrustful of outsiders and new ideas. Faced with incursion into their territory, weremuskrats invariably withdraw further into the wilderness. As a result, weremuskrat populations have dwindled to the point that they are rarely encountered by other humanoids.
