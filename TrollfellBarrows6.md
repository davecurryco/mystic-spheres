# Trollfell Barrows

## The Warning

As the plateau progresses, the space between the cliffs opens and the rocky ground gives way first to heather and then to low hillocks covered with mangy grass. Between these are gullies in which grow briars and even gnarled, stunted trees. Occasionally, the party must cross a small creek of sluggish, dark water.

While pausing for a break after crossing one of these creeks, the party’s (warlock/druid/sorcerer/ranger) notices a thicket of briar above the banks of the creek that looks much like a hedge in which he played when he was young. The briar of the hedge was unlike any other plant in the area where the character grew up and in all his time in the wild, he has never seen another briar of the same sort until now. For a character so familiar with woodland flora, there can be no mistaking the reddish, spearhead-shaped leaves, wicked thorns, and delicate, star-shaped white flowers of fey briar, as it is called. The character feels a strange compulsion to investigate the thicket alone.

If the character follows this feeling, he will remember that the tops of the briar hedge at home arched over the base to form a kind of tunnel in which he spent many happy hours in his childhood, sitting among the bed of dead leaves at the base of the hedge and hiding from the other children to be alone with his imagination. Pushing carefully past the sharp thorns of the outside branches, the character finds that the thicket is formed exactly as he remembers and that the tunnel is large enough for him to fit inside. The character longs to sit among the leaves once more and truly be alone.

If the character sits inside the thicket for a few minutes, he will remember an incident from his childhood. Playing in the hedge, the character pushed back a branch which recoiled against his face. One of the thorns scratched his left eyeball. Howling in pain, he ran all the way home. The local (priest/druid/wise woman/doctor) was called to remove the thorn and was very concerned when he could not find the very tip of it. The young character’s eye swelled horribly and everyone was concerned that he might lose the sight of it, but after a week the tissue healed and the sight in the wounded eye returned. Thinking back, it will strike the character that it was shortly after that that the (visions/calling/power) came that he eventually followed to his current vocation.

Just as he finishes this reverie, the character will hear a rustling among the leaves farther along in the tunnel. Boxed in by the cramped space and prevented by the thorns from making a hasty escape, the character’s hand automatically makes its way to a favored weapon. Just then, a strange figure steps into view — a dwarf by his size, but clean shaved;  a gnome by his slightly pointed ears and aged looks, but bald; a halfling by his ruddy complexion, but wiry and somewhat hunchbacked. The figure is dressed in grey wool pants, a greenish, roughspun tunic, a leather vest, yellow boots, and a red skullcap. He carries no weapons, except perhaps the gnarled, black walking-stick he holds in his left hand. His right eye squints and, as if to make up for it, his left eye bulges slightly from its socket. He carries a small wooden cask on his right shoulder, which accentuates his stooped posture and hunched back. When he sees the character, the figure smiles broadly and says in Common, “Ah, they said you’d be here and here you are! We’ve somewhat to talk about, you and I. Will you have a crock?” With that, Folg, for that is his name, sets down the cask and proffers an earthenware mug.

The tunnel of fey briar is, in fact a crossing between the Aelvalon realms of Faelon and Cymmyrion. Folg is a denizen of the Greenwood, sent to warn the character that the adventurers are tangling with an ancient evil allied with the Tyrant.


## 6 Barrow of Melanzarad (Azruun Deathlord)

_Occupied and intact_

Infamous even among the Azruun for his cruelty, Melanzarad the Deathbringer was field-marshal of the army that invaded Asarial. After the fall of Galanhirion, an elven fortress that stood on the bluff where the town of Delastarion was later built, Melanzarad ordered the defenders to be put to an agonizing death and their women given over for the amusement of his troops. At the height of a debauched celebration, one of the captive elven women performed a dance that entranced the Azruun lord. She enticed him to a balcony on a tower overlooking the Telannon river for a private rendezvous beneath the starlight. Suddenly seizing the field-marshall in an iron grasp, the elf threw herself off the balcony, toppling Melanzarad with her into the water far below. Both were killed and, although the body of the elven dancer was never found, Melanzarad's corpse was fished out of the river and entombed in state. However, the dark deeds of his life and the ignominious manner of this death kept the warlord's spirit behind in the mortal world. He now haunts this barrow along with a number of wights created from intruders he killed.

Pentalya found that this barrow had been discovered. Over the years, she has manipulated several parties of adventurers to attempt to plunder it, but they have only been added to the population of wights. Moreso than any of the other barrows, Melanzarad’s dolmen has the character of an abode of the restless undead.

## Level 1

### Entrance

Melenzarad’s grass-covered barrow is unusual in that the top of the burial mound is a shallow, dish-shaped depression. At its center is an obelisk of rough, black basalt some 15 feet high. It is set on a circular base of the same material that is flush with the ground. An observant character might notice (Perception DC 17) that there are Azruun runes inscribed in a border around the base. Additional study (Arcana DC 23) may reveal that the circle is the destination of a linked portal. The obelisk has four smooth faces. At the top of each face is a deeply-etched crest of a snarling wolf’s head. The rest is covered in Azruun runes extolling the military prowess of Melanzarad the Deathbringer. The runes narrate Melanzarad’s career from his beginnings as a tribal warlord to his victories as captain of Narustur’s armies, with a great deal of emphasis on his wake of destruction, plunder, rapine, and impalements. The story culminates in the Azruun victory at Galanhirion (Delestarion, or Akrunazad, as the Azruun styled it). The narrative does not mention the manner of the great general’s demise or the character of his eternal destiny.

The base of the obelisk is the permanent destination locus of a linked portal. There is a permanent origin locus in the Portal Chamber on Level 2. This makes the area within 12 squares of the obelisk visible to guards stationed in the Teleportation Chamber. The runes on the obelisk are also seeded with a subtle enchantment, so as to form a trap for the unwary:

Monument of Visions Level 15 Lurker

Trap XP 1,200

The monument ahead is covered with writing relating an important historical incident in an archaic language. Although the text seems mundane, anyone who reads it becomes drawn into the narrative until his mind is taken over by the sights and sounds of the events depicted.

Trap: Taking the form of a large marker devoted to deeds long past, this monument attempts to dominate those who attempt to read it.
Perception

No check is required to see the monument.

Additional Skill: Religion  
DC 27: The character recognizes that there are words of power cunningly worked into the text such that anyone reading them will unknowingly perform a ritual in his own mind.  

Trigger  
When a creature reads the text for more than 1 round by magical or nonmagical means, the trap attacks.

Attack  
Standard Action Ranged 5  
Target: All creatures reading the text on the monument.  
Attack: +19 vs. Will  
Hit: Target is dominated (save ends).  
Aftereffect: Target is dazed (save ends).  

Countermeasures  
A character can attack the monument (AC 26, other defenses 24; hp 125; resist 15 all). Destroying the monument disables the trap.

For each round that a character spends within 12 squares of the obelisk, there is a 1 in 10 chance that he will be observed by the guard wight in the Portal Chamber. Although not particularly harmful, the obelisk trap may well keep one or more characters in range for longer than they intended and the obelisk will force dominated creatures to reveal themselves if they are invisible or otherwise hidden.

On the north inner slope of the depression, two grey granite staircases descend to rusted iron doors set within posts and lintels of the same grey stone. The doors are identical - banded with iron straps in which are set iron spikes and fitted with door-pulls cast in the shape of wheels of fire.

### Left Antechamber

The door to the left antechamber is unlocked and can be opened with a little exertion (Strength DC 13). Inside is an unlit, stone-lined chamber with an iron grate in the center of its slate-flagged floor. The chamber is a scene of horror. Humanoid bones and skulls, ancient and recent, litter the floor in hundreds along with a clutter of long-decayed weapons, armor and gear. Close inspection (Nature DC 17) will reveal that, although the more recent victims are goblins or orcs, there are a number of human and dwarven corpses among the older remains and even an ancient skull in a helmet of distinctively elven make. A narrow path cuts through the piles of bones to a passageway in the wall. The lintel above the passageway bears an inscription in Azruun runes:

_The earth is black_  
_where trod my steed._  
_Bringer of Death_  
_in word and deed._  

### Right Antechamber

The door at the bottom of the right entrance staircase is barred from the inside (Strength DC 28 to force, Thievery DC 23 to open). The antechamber beyond is lined in stone with a ceiling 8 feet high. On one wall, bars of black wrought iron fashioned in a bones-and-skulls motif wards entry to a smaller chamber. A door made of iron bars of the same design stands open.

The antechamber is inhabited by two slaughter wights, the revenants of a pair of barbarian adventurers who met horrid fates in the barrow:

2 Slaughter Wights (Level 18 Brute)

The floor of the smaller chamber contains a well 30 feet deep with walls of green stone some three feet high. The lip of the well is carved with Azruun runes and many rusted iron chains set with cruel spikes hang from pulleys and hooks in the ceiling into the dark water 10 feet below. A small unlocked wooden chest with iron bands lies amid a pile of copper, silver, and gold coins in one corner. The treasure hoard contains:

* Jacinth in a platinum ring (5,000 GP)
* Emerald in a gold brooch (1,000 GP)
* Assorted gold personal ornaments and piercing studs (650 GP)
* 2,211 GP
* 13,652 SP
* 6,323 CP

Two chain devils are magically bound to the chains. They will animate the chains to attack, but cannot themselves take form or leave the squares immediately adjacent to the well. Each of the chain devils will instead animate a cluster of chains, which gains the defenses and other characteristics of the chain devil itself (including its reach of 2, which works unimpeded by the bars). Working this way, the chain devils cannot use dance of battle or dance of defiance. However, they can sustain hellish chains against a single creature with a minor action. Each time a creature restrained by hellish chains fails a save, the creature is pulled 2 squares through the open door and toward the well. Once in the well, the chain devils hold the restrained creature submerged in the brackish water in an attempt to drown it.

While submerged, the target is also subject to attacks from the vengeful spirits of three of Onalekama’s handmaidens who were sacrificed in the well. These trap haunts will attempt to use ghostly possession to cause their intended victim to cease struggling and accept its fate as they were forced to accept theirs.

2 Chain Devils (Level 11 Skirmisher)
3 Trap Haunts (Level 8 Lurker)

The chain devils and trap haunts will not attack the wights (or any other undead). The slaughter wights took advantage of this to collect the grave offerings cast into the water with the maidens and safeguard it along with the plunder from their other kills made over the long years since they were raised as undead. The jacinth in particular has an interesting story in that one of the handmaidens stole it as her mistress was led away to suttee, not realizing that she herself would be the next to feel the priests’ garrote around her neck.

Although the slaughter wights will move immediately to attack any living creature that enters the chamber, they will retreat to the small chamber to gain the cover of the bars and the protection of the chain devils if their opponents seem unexpectedly strong.

### Left Hallway

A hallway five feet wide and 7 feet high leads away from the left antechamber. It turns sharply and opens on another small chamber.

### Bas-Relief Chamber

This small chamber is 10 feet wide and 10 feet high. A portcullis of black iron worked with a motif of spikes and skulls guards an exit on the opposite side of the entrance. The walls are of a cream-colored stone with black stone borders carved with Azruun runes along the top and bottom. Between the borders is a carved bas-relief depicting Menelzarad leading armies against the elves. The life-size stylized soldiers in the foreground of the Deathlord’s army seem to capture the very spirit of disciplined fighting men. They stand at attention, but seem poised eagerly for action.

The soldiers in the bas-relief are actually constructs animated by the spirits of the former bodyguard of Menelzarad, imprisoned in this chamber as eternal guardians to deter the living from entering this abode of the dead.

12 Stonecut Soldiers (Level 12 Soldier)

The portcullis is a trap as well:

Ironthorn Portcullis Level 12 Obstacle  

Hazard XP 700

Found in dungeons and tombs, an ironthorn portcullis is a construct created to guard entrances to important areas. It grants access only to creatures that meet some condition specified at its creation and unyieldingly attacks those who do not.

Hazard: An ironthorn portcullis guards access to a single square, usually a doorway, hallway or similar portal. More than one iron thorn portcullis can be placed to ward wider passages.

Perception  
No check is necessary to notice the ironthorn portcullis.

Additional Skill: Dungeoneering  
DC 26: The character identifies the gateway as an ironthorn portcullis.

Trigger  
The ironthorn portcullis attacks when a creature that does not meet the access condition enters or begins adjacent to the portcullis.

Attack  
Opportunity Action Melee  
Target: Each creature adjacent to the portcullis  
Attack: +17 vs. AC  
Hit: 2d10 + 7 damage and immobilized until escape. The attack deals 3d10 + 7 damage if the target is unarmored or is equipped with non-metallic armor.  

Countermeasures  
* Immobilized characters can use the Acrobatics or Athletics (DC 23) to free themselves.
* A character can attack a square of ironthorn portcullis (AC 23, other defenses 20; hp 140; resist 20 to all damage). Once a square is destroyed, it cannot attack and can no longer deny passage.

The stonecut soldiers will stay merged with stone until the ironthorn portcullis attacks. Only one stonecut soldier can occupy any given square of the wall at any given time. When a soldier is bloodied, it will withdraw to regenerate, allowing a reinforcement to shift to fill the gap.

The wights and other undead inhabiting this barrow meet the access conditions of both the stonecut soldiers and the ironthorn portcullis and can pass unimpeded through both areas.

### Iron Maiden Chamber

A small chamber joins the hallway to the larger rooms beyond. A door of black iron wards the exit. It is unlocked and is only a little rusted (Strength DC 13 to open). Sconces of black wrought iron are set into the wall on either side of the door. These are set with ebony torches that eternally burn with a purplish light that illuminates the room with dim light. This light counters bright light brought into the room, reducing it to dim light. If the bright light is magical, the wielder can make an Arcana or Religion check against DC 23 to overcome the dim light. Unless overcome, the eerie light grants undead creatures in the room resist 5 radiance.

In a niche in the corner stands what looks like a sarcophagus made of black iron. It is covered in small knobs fitted onto threaded bolts that extend into its interior. The face of the sarcophagus is worked in the likeness of a stylized woman’s face contorted with pain and with mouth open in a perpetual scream. The mouth and eyes of the face are openings into the interior of the sarcophagus. This is, in fact, an iron maiden, a favorite device of Melanzarad left here for his use in the afterlife.

This chamber is the abode of three lesser wights, who will rabidly attack any creature that enters:

2 Wights (Level 5 Skirmisher)
Deathlock Wight (Level 4 Controller)

The two regular wights will rise from the floor on either side of the door, while the deathlock wight will attack from within the iron maiden, which grants superior cover.

### Sacrificial Chamber

This large chamber has a 12 foot high ceiling of black basalt supported on arches of white marble supported on both sides by a colonnades of white marble, forming small arcades around a central nave. The arches and columns are carved to suggest that they are composed of bones and skulls.

At one end of the room, the floor opens on a pit some 20 feet deep. The top of the pit is flush with the floor and its stone lip is surrounded with a circle of Azruun runes of decidedly arcane and evil character inlaid in silver in the black stone floor. On the wall of the chancel at the head of the room is a rack of black wrought iron fitted with manacles. The rack is sloped in such a way as to allow a body released from the manacles to slide easily into the pit, but the rack does not protrude into the space above the circle of runes. In niches in the nave on either side of the rack are small statues of rampant, ravening dire wolves cast of black iron with eyes of blood-red garnet (4 @ 100 GP). The artwork is stylized as the wolves are icons representative of one of the aspects of Morrigu.

As an act of revenge for Melanzarad’s death and in propitiation of his spirit, nine captive elven women were sacrificed here by impalement and their bodies fed to a shadow-demon summoned into the pit. This act bound the demon and the spirits of the captives to the defense of the barrow, but other than a lingering sense of evil and unease left no traces in the chamber itself.

A thick door of black stone is set in the center of the wall opposite the rack. It is closed fast and cannot be opened by force. A row of three niches in the door holds three elven skulls. Below the row of niches there are columns of Azruun runes carved into the door. They read:

_Melanzarad the Deathbringer hath said, “There can be no parley with the elves. Of any three of them, one will always speak the truth, one will always speak a lie, and what the third will say no one can know.”_

_Yet, if thou must ask each of three such one question that can be known to mortals, and if each can reply but with ‘yes’, ’no' or silence, choose he who speaks the truth._

This is a puzzle designed by the tomb designer around a famous saying of Melanzarad. Each of the skulls will indeed answer a single question with ‘yes’, ‘no’ or silence:

| Skull  | Answer |
| ------ | ------ |
| Left   | Random (d6 when asked; 1-3 = ‘yes', 4-6 = ’no') |
| Center | Truth (or silence if the answer cannot be known) |
| Right  | Lie (or silence if the answer cannot be known) |

Anyone who knows the secret can open the door trivially by pressing the center skull. The puzzle can also be solved in two questions:

1) Directed to A:  
Would you and B give the same answer to the question of X? The reply to this question can be used to identify a skull that isn’t Random. If there is no answer, then B is Random. If the answer is either ‘yes’ or ‘no’, then B is not Random.

2) Directed to one of A or B (the interlocutor) we now know not to be Random:  
Would you and C give the same answer to the question of X? The reply to this question positively identifies the skulls. If there is no answer, then C is Random and which of A or B is Truth can be determined by the answer to A. If the answer is ‘yes’ then C is Truth. If the answer is ‘no’ then the interlocutor is Truth.

The following table is a key to these answers. A full explanation can be found at How to solve the hardest logic puzzle ever in two questions.

| Skull  | Answer |
| ------ | ------ |
| Left   | Random (d6 when asked; 1-3 = ‘yes', 4-6 = ’no') |
| Center | You and Left: silence; You and Right: ‘no' |
| Right  | You and Left: silence; You and Center: ‘yes' |

The niches have been enchanted to protect the skulls from becoming dirty or worn and thus betraying which has been used to open the door. To discourage random guessing, a wrong answer will cause one of the skulls to animate as a great shadowskull. The shadowskull will instantly teleport to the bottom of the pit, from whence it will emerge later to harass the party with all its malicious genius. The skull will remain missing for 24 hours or until the shadowskull is destroyed, thus preventing the party from opening the door.

Great Shadowskull (Level 18 Artillery)

The party could also try to destroy the door (AC 10, Fortitude 20, hit points 160, resist 20 to all damage). However, any attack on the door or on the skulls will cause all three skulls to animate as great shadowskulls, each of which will immediately teleport up to 10 squares away and proceed to attack the party in concert with the others.

### Trophy Chamber

Behind the Door of Skulls is a chamber dedicated to the display of trophies from Melanzarad’s campaigns. Racks on two of the walls hold a large assortment of weapons and captured standards, many of them of elven. These are all rusted and decayed with time, with a few exceptions:

* Magic weapon (Spear, Level 16 +4)
* Piercing Songblade (Short sword, Level 13 +3)
* Berserker weapon (Scimitar, Level 10 +2)
* Symbol of Hope (Istarian, Level 8 +2)

On one wall, a rack of black wrought iron holds scores of skulls, many of them elven. Arrayed in front of these are three large bronze urns, each fitted with a lid sealed with lead. These are filled 1/4 full with hundreds of pieces of what looks like blackened leather. Expert examination (Nature DC 20) can identify these as elf ears that were packed in these urns and preserved with natron. A DC 20 History check will recall that Melanzarad ordered trophies to be taken from his victims at the siege of Galanhirion.

A short distance from the door, a stone staircase descends to Level -1.

### Guardian Chamber

On the opposite side of the Sacrificial Chamber an iron door (unlocked, Strength DC 13 to open) opens on a small chamber. Along its walls stand 5 upright sarcophagi of bronze, each of which bears a crest in the form of a stylized, snarling wolf’s head surrounded by rows of Azruun runes.

Inside the chamber, four battle wights and their commander wile away the time waiting on their Lord with endless games of dice played on the floor. If they are taken without warning, the wraiths will be crouched in a corner over their game (2 pairs of dice, one of jet and one of ivory, with inlays of electrum worth 220 GP per pair; stakes of 327 GP, 1,513 SP and an aquamarine pendant worth 500 GP). Their weapons will be to hand, but the adventurers will have a surprise round as the wights scramble to their feet and draw their weapons. If there are any suspicious sounds from any of the adjacent chambers (Passive perception 22), the wights will hasten to investigate.

4 Battle Wights (Level 9 Soldier)
Battle Wight Commander (Level 12 Soldier - Leader) - Azelharad

The wights were members of the personal bodyguard of Melanzarad chosen by lot to follow him into death. They are bound by oaths of eternal allegiance and their leader, Azelharad is clever and resolute. The wights will act according to the tactical situation as they understand it and may well send one of their number to alert other denizens of the barrow while the rest set up an ambush.

### Juggernaut Chamber

This chamber has a 12-foot high ceiling supported by arches set on pilasters. The door to the Guardian Chamber is of black iron, slightly rusted, but still very strong and bolted from within (Strength DC 28 to force, Thievery DC 23 to open). The chamber is constructed of gray granite with a black marble floor. The pilasters are of brownish poryphry with veins of gold and capitals and finals decorated with a motif of running wolves picked out in gold leaf.

At one end of the chamber, the ceiling is flat and reaches only 10 feet above the floor. This part of the ceiling is covered by rectangular plates of cast bronze, each about a food feet wide 4 feet broad. Each plate is worked in a geometric, openwork design with a solid border. The plates themselves are set within a bronze frame that is flush with the ceiling. This apparatus is actually a set of retractable stairs that leads up to the second level. The stairs are normally drawn up into a well in the ceiling, preventing access to the level above.

At the end of the chamber opposite the staircase is a shrine made entirely of bronze. The shrine’s base is set on wheels of bronze and its peaked roof reaches a height of 9 feet. The centerpiece of the shrine is a 1/2 scale bronze equestrian statue of Melanzarad in full ceremonial military regalia and bearing a horseman’s glaive. Before the statue is an ornate bronze bowl, which is fixed to the base. The bowl is crusted with dark, rust-colored matter. A plaque placed beneath the eaves of the shrine’s roof toward the front reads:

_Hail Melanzarad, Deathbringer,_  
_whose wake was Shadow!_  
_Bring him homage who crushed his foes,_  
_before his unstoppable onslaught!_  

The shrine is the key to opening the staircase, but it is also a trap:

Bronze Guardian Juggernaut Level 16 Elite Blaster

Trap XP 1,400

When this trap is triggered, a large bronze shrine on wheels springs forward, crushing everything in its path.
Trap: A ritual performed correctly before the shrine bestows some benefit on the caster, but failure triggers the shrine to roll forward suddenly and unstoppably.

Perception  
- DC 13: A character in the room notices that the wheels of the shrine are set in bronze tracks that extend the length of the room.  
- DC 25: A character realizes that tongues of bronze that run from the base of the shrine to grooves within the tracks are under powerful tension.  

Initiative +6

Speed 8

Trigger  
If the ritual of the shrine is performed incorrectly, roll initiative. On its initiative count, the juggernaut moves forward and then returns to its starting position, attacking creatures in its path along the way. The juggernaut will continue to move and attack in this way on its initiative for 3 turns.

Attack  
Standard Action or Immediate Interrupt  
Area trample attack in squares entered by the juggernaut  
Trample: Each turn, the juggernaut moves its speed and enters creatures' spaces. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The juggernaut ends its move in the square where it began.  
When the juggernaut enters a square adjacent to a creature, the juggernaut makes a trample attack. If a creature enters a square of the juggernaut's space, the juggernaut makes a trample attack as a free action.  
Trample Attack: +22 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 4d12 + 7 damage, and the target is knocked prone.  
Miss: Half damage.  

Countermeasures  
* One character of size medium or smaller can enter the juggernaut’s space (jump aboard) before it starts rolling. This character will move along with the juggernaut and is immune to the juggernaut’s attacks. The character can even make attacks from the juggernaut as if it were a mount.
* A character adjacent to the juggernaut can stop it with a DC 35 Athletics check. Making this attempt provokes a trample attack as an immediate interrupt, and the character's Athletics check fails if the juggernaut's trample attack hits.
* A character of size medium or smaller can make a DC 25 Acrobatics check to jump aboard the juggernaut once it starts rolling. If the check succeeds, the character can ride the juggernaut as previously described. Making this attempt provokes a trample attack as an immediate interrupt, and the character's Acrobatics check fails if the juggernaut's trample attack hits.
* One or more characters in the juggernaut’s space (underneath it) before it begins to roll can disable the trap with a DC 30 Thievery check. If the attempt fails, the juggernaut begins to roll and automatically scores a critical hit on the characters making the attempt.

The ritual to open the staircase is simple. A creature standing before the shrine must pour humanoid blood into the bowl and recite, in Azruun, the inscription on the plaque. The staircase can be forced open (Thievery DC 20, Strength DC 28), but doing so will trigger the juggernaut.

Due to the pervasive necrotic influence of the barrow, several adventurers killed by the juggernaut became trap-haunts. Two of these vengeful spirits infest the shrine and two more hide in the staircase well. The ghosts will stay hidden at first, only to emerge and attack at the most inopportune moment:

4 Trap Haunts (Level 8 Lurker)

The trap haunts will, of course, use ghostly possession to force any characters attempting to disable the trap or open the staircase to trigger the juggernaut instead. Once the juggernaut is rolling, the ghosts will seek to keep their targets within its area of effect, using their phasing power to escape damage themselves.

## Level -1

### Harem

At the bottom of the stairs is a bronze door with three cast panels which bear a motif of interlaced thorns and birds of prey. The door is barred from the inside (Strength DC 23 or Thievery DC 28 to open).

This chamber has a ceiling of white marble with a floor of alternating blocks of beige and dark rose marble. The walls are painted with borders of the same interlaced thorn motif. The arched ceiling is 10 feet high. A small pool lined in white rose-colored marble is set in the center of the floor, but it is dry. Along the wall farthest from the staircase stand a row of three upright sarcophagi, beautifully decorated with gold leaf and enamel.

Unless the adventurers arrive in this chamber completely undetected, they will find the following scenario:

Before the sarcophagi stand three beautiful women with pale grayish skin and lustrous black eyes that have no whites, like a raven’s. Their hair is dressed in elaborate style and their arms and shoulders are adorned with ornate tattoos which feature birds of prey. They wear simple gowns of in pale pastel shades and personal adornments (including many piercings) of gold decorated with enamel and semiprecious stones. These are Melanzarad’s consorts, interred with him to serve his needs in the afterlife. They arose as undead with their master and are bound to his will:

2 Gravesiren Wights (Level 9 Skirmisher)
Lamia (Level 12 Elite Controller) - Eklabeth

Depending on the tactical situation, the undead women will prefer to entice intruders into a trap. Given the opportunity, the lamia, Eklabeth, will hold her arms wide in a gesture of nonaggression and will say, in Azruun, “Who comes to disturb our long slumber under grass and stone? What would the living here in the halls of the dead?” The two wights will act the part of demure handmaidens, casting shy, sidelong glances at the adventurers as their mistress does the talking. Eklabeth will play as many foes as she can within range of her pacifying burst before she attacks. On cue from their mistress, the wights will use grave song to transfix any unaffected enemies and will move forward to defend her while waiting for the guardians in the next chamber to enter the fray. If she can, Eklabeth will stay out of direct melee combat in order to target any particularly troublesome foes with devouring swarm. If bloodied, she will use squeezing swarm to escape through the drain in the pool and will emerge through the drain in the Torture Chamber.

If the undead have no warning of the party’s presence, the adventurers will note only the three sarcophagi. Eklabeth is in the sarcophagus in the center, resting as a swarm of beetles, while the two wights occupy the others. They will immediately attack as soon as the first sarcophagus is opened and the ruckus will draw the guardians from the next room.

If the characters vanquish the female undead, they will find the following grave goods on their desiccated corpses:

* Assorted gold and enamel jewelry (1,200 GP)
* Periapt of Wisdom (Level 13 +3)
* Gold and enamel necklace set with three 300 GP alexandrite gems (1,500 GP)

### Torture Chamber

A portcullis of closely-set black wrought iron bars wards the approach to this chamber. At its center is a wrought-iron boss cast in the shape of a stylized wolf’s head. The portcullis is normally raised, unless there has been an alert, in which case it will be dropped and locked from inside (Thievery DC 20 to unlock, Strength DC 25 to open). Levers to unlock and raise the portcullis are mounted on the wall inside the chamber, near but not too close to the entryway.

The Azruun believed that the dead should be equipped for the afterlife by supplying their embalmed bodies with the things they enjoyed in this life. For this reason, Melnazarad’s barrow was built with a chamber furnished for the use of harsh interrogation techniques. The amenities include a vertical rack, a brazier, and a variety of instruments of pain. An iron maiden stands in one corner, where it could be mistaken for a sarcophagus, but for the fact that it is open and so the cruel spikes that line the inside are fully visible.

The iron maiden is the lair of a trap haunt, the spirit of one of its victims.

Trap Haunt (Level 8 Lurker)

Typical of its kind, the trap haunt will attempt to possess a living creature that enters the room, force it into the iron maiden and close the lid. Once the target is inside, it takes 4d4 + 4 damage at the start of each of its turns and is restrained until it makes a successful escape check.

This chamber is also the lair of seven more wights.

4 Battle Wights (Level 9 Soldier)
2 Slaughter Wights (Level 18 Brute)
Battle Wight Commander (Level 12 Soldier - Leader)

These undead are mobile and directed by a capable leader. Depending on the tactical situation, they could be encountered anywhere on this level. The commander will tend to send the slaughter wights into combat first as shock troops and follow up with his more disciplined soldiers.

### Tribute Chamber

The entryway to this chamber is warded by another portcullis identical to the one that guards the entryway to the Torture Chamber.

This chamber is floored in dark grey granite and has an arched roof 10 feet high at its apex. The walls are decorated with bas-relief scenes of Azruun soldiers subduing armies of hobgoblins, humans and elves, enslaving their women, and forcing them to bring tribute to two central figures riding in a chariot. One of the figures is meant to be Melanzarad and the other is a hooded and cloaked humanoid whose face cannot be seen, but whose hands are those of a women, albeit with wickedly long and sharp-looking fingernails.

This chamber is filled with grave goods of the most extravagant kind, including a gilded chariot complete with a mummified horse. Two weapon-racks hang near the chariot. One contains an assortment of spears and javelins as well as two bows and many arrows in gilded and enameled wooden cases. The other rack holds two sets of ornate banded armor. A gilded and enameled throne sits in a corner. A large unlocked chest, similarly decorated, holds a sizable wardrobe. All of these goods are too deteriorated with age to be of any worth.

Among the grave goods is a smaller chest of wood lacquered in black with tiny gold flecks. It is locked (Thievery DC 17) and warded with a sigil:

Lesser Sigil of Sealing Level 12 Warder

Trap XP 700

A glowing, blue arcane sigil seals the chest. When the seal is broken, the sigil erupts into a swarm of tiny, icy demons that sting and freeze all exposed flesh.

Trap: A magical sigil silently wards a container, threatening dire consequences if it is unsealed.

Perception  
DC 7: The character notices the sigil.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 23: The character understands that the sigil can only be disabled by successive application of Arcana and Thievery skills  
DC 30: The character understands the character of the sigil and provides a +2 bonus to Arcana and Thievery checks made to disable it  

Trigger  
When a creature tries to open the seal or destroy the guarded container, the sigil attacks.

Attack  
Immediate Reaction Wall 8 within 1 square  
Targets: All creatures in blast  
Attack: +19 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 4d8 + 5 cold and poison damage and the target slides 1 square in a random direction.  
Miss: Half damage and the target does not slide.  

Countermeasures  
* An adjacent character can disable the sigil with a DC 25 Arcana check followed immediately by a DC 25 Thievery check.

The chest contains:

* Skull Mask (Level 15) (Adventurer’s Vault pp. 144)

### Crypt Staircase

A staircase of dark grey slate leads down to a door of black iron. On the reddish stone wall on either side of the staircase are life-size bas-relief carvings of dire wolves sitting alert with bared fangs and bristled tails. These are actually magical constructs called stonecut dire wolves, whose eternal task it is to guard Melanzarad’s Crypt:

4 Stonecut Dire Wolves (Level 10 Soldier)

The door is entirely free of rust and is heavily reinforced. It is closed and locked. A central boss wrought in the shape of a snarling wolf’s head decorates the center of the door. Inside the wolf’s mouth is a handle.

Handle of Soul Entrapment Level 13 Obstacle

Trap XP 800

You grasp the door’s handle and it radiates negative energy. You find that you cannot withdraw your hand as you feel your vitality being drained away.

Trap: The only way to open a portal warded by this trap is to grasp the handle with the bare hand of a creature and squeeze with considerable might (Strength DC 25). The trap will immediately attack living creatures, but it will open the door if grasped by an undead creature.

Perception  
DC 7: The character notices that the handle is recessed into the surface of the door in a way that suggests entrapment.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 23: The character recognizes that the door cannot be opened except by grasping the handle with a bare hand.  
DC 25: The character’s knowledge provides a +2 bonus to Fortitude against the trap's attack.  

Trigger  
When the handle is grasped with the bare hand of a living creature, the trap attacks immediately and sustains the effect each round on its turn.

Attack  
Opportunity Action Melee  
Target: Creature touching the handle  
Attack: +18 vs. Fortitude.  
Hit: 3d10 + 6 necrotic and psychic damage and immobilized (save ends). Ongoing 10 necrotic damage and the target saves at -2 in any round in which the target takes necrotic damage.  
Miss: Half damage and dazed until the end of the target's next turn.  

Countermeasures  
It should occur to any genuinely evil character that the hand grasping the handle need not be his own.

The stonecut dire wolves will not attack unless a living creature opens the door.

### Melanzarad’s Crypt

This chamber is floored in polished black marble. The walls and high, vaulted ceiling are of white marble. There is a large black marble sarcophagus on a dias set in a niche at the far end of the chamber. It is decorated with a border of Azruun runes inscribed in gold leaf. At the near edge of the dias are two black wrought iron candelabra. They glimmer with an eerie, dim, purplish light that only deepens the shadows in the niche. Around the base of the sarcophagus crouch four wolves cast in black wrought iron. Their eyes are dark purple gems that gleam with the light reflected from the candlesticks. Flanking the niche, two warriors in plate armor stand at guard. Their hands rest on the hilts of their greatswords, which glow

The cast iron wolves are actually darkiron defenders, unsleeping guardian constructs that will give warning and defend their charge if any intruders enter the crypt.

As a wight, Melanzarad is obliged to spend much of his time in his tomb. However, he is not the type to lie about idly while intruders have the run of the place. He will respond aggressively to intrusion and choose tactics according to how much warning he has had. This may alter the circumstances of several of the encounters in the barrow:

| Warning Source | Tactics |
| Guard wight from Portal Chamber | Send wights from Guardian Chamber through obelisk portal to ambush party. Have rest of guards put on alert. |
| Wights from Level 1 | Send wights from Torture Chamber upstairs via staircase in Trophy Room to reinforce wights in Guardian Chamber, attacking party from behind if possible. Defend Crypt as below. |
| Shadow skulls from Sacrifice Chamber | Send wights from Torture Chamber to wait in ambush in hall outside Harem. Send one death knight forward to choke off party at Torture Chamber, attempting to isolate one party member with the portcullis and falling back if pressed. Defend Crypt as below. |
| Wights from Level -1 | Send surviving wights through secret door in Crypt to attack party from behind. Send one death knight forward to choke off party at Tribute Chamber, attempting to isolate one party member with the portcullis and falling back if pressed. Defend Crypt as below. |
| Stonecut Dire Wolves | Position death knight and darkiron defenders to choke off doorway. Stand in square between candelabra and ready attacks. Trigger darkness burst and retreat through secret shaft when bloodied, leaving guardians to slow down party. Rally surviving defenders or if none remain, abandon barrow. |
| Darkiron Defenders | Lie in sarcophagus for one round to allow darkiron defenders and death knight to engage intruders. Rise and fight from cover of candelabra as above. |

The wrought iron candelabra are enchanted with necrotic magic. They give off a dim light from the sphere of shadow that cancels other light sources that would otherwise illuminate the squares within a 1 square radius. The shadows produced by this light lightly obscure these squares. Creatures in the squares illuminated by the light gain resist 5 to radiant damage. Once per day as a minor action, the candelabra can be commanded to emit a close burst 3 attack that will extinguish all normal light sources and magical light sources of less than 16th level (these can be relit). The attack also targets creatures in the area of effect; +18 vs. Fortitude; 3d8 + 5 necrotic damage and the target is dazed (save ends).

Battle Wight General (Level 16 Solo Soldier) - Melanzarad
2 Death Knights (Human Fighter) (Level 16 Elite Soldier)
4 Darkiron Defenders (Level 9 Soldier)

If the party defeats Melanzarad, they will find the following treasure on his remains:

* Supporting Armor (Plate, Level 15 +3) (Adventurer’s Vault 2)
* Shadowrift Blade (Longsword, Level 12 +3) (Adventurer’s Vault 2)
* Gold collar and bracelets (2,500 GP)

In addition, each of the darkiron defenders has two 500 GP purple amethysts embedded in its eye-sockets.

## Level 2

### Portal Chamber

This chamber is constructed of grey granite. The ceiling is supported with pilasters and low arches and is 8 feet high at the walls and 10 feet high at its apex. The floor is a darker grey granite. In one corner, an obvious magic circle is inscribed. Inside the circle, a hazy reflection of an outdoor space is visible. An astute observer (Insight DC 17) will recognize the dish-shaped clearing around the obelisk, shown as if the observer were standing in the center of the base of the obelisk.

A battle wight stands guard in this room at all times. At intervals of several minutes, he walks from one corner of the room to another to monitor the clearing from different angles.

Battle Wight (Level 9 Soldier)

A door of iron-bound cedar stands in one wall. It is carved with a border with a design of interlaced thorns interspersed with ravens and has a central boss of wrought iron decorated with a crest representing three ravens in flight and a pull fashioned in the form of a circle of interlaced thorn branches. The ironwork was gilded, but it is heavily rusted. The door itself is sealed shut and is still sound (Thievery DC 20 to open, Strength DC 20 to force).

### Burial Chamber

This chamber is built in light gray granite with pilasters and low arches supporting the ceiling. The floor is a dark grey marble with swirls and flecks of mica. At the end of the chamber nearest the door is a gilded throne chair that reflects the thorn-and-raven motif. It is flanked by two gilded and enameled chests. At the far end of the room is a sarcophagus of dark rose marble. At its base and beneath its lid are borders comprised of Azruun runes interspersed with the thorn-and-raven motif. Expert examination (Religion DC 17) will reveal that the runes are ones of repose and protection invoking the power of Morrigu, the Goddess of Death.

The sarcophagus contains the mummified remains of Melanzarad’s wife, Onalekama, whose name appears among the runes. The daughter of an ancient bloodline, Onalekama followed the traditions of her ancestors in worshiping Morrigu. Over the course of Melanzarad’s career, Onalekama constantly urged her husband to consecrate his victories to the Goddess she served and to spare no captive, man, woman or child. It was largely at his wife’s prompting that Melanzarad earned his sobriquet, “The Deathbringer”. It was only in his last campaign that the vile influence of Natastur corrupted Melanzarad to the darker excesses of power. Indeed, the Deathbringer's downfall can be directly traced to his decision to spare the womenfolk of Galanhirion, albeit for his own lustful purposes.

As a devout follower of Lady Death, Onalekama was spared the fate of her husband and his cohort to rise as undead. She lies here peacefully surrounded by treasures from her dowry:

Chest  
* 200 bars of silver (20,000 SP)
* 20 bars of gold (1,000 GP)

Chest  
* Plain dress of fine spider silk in an iridescent pale purple and clasped with three small mithril brooches fashioned in the shape of spiders with death’s head markings (3,000 GP). This was Onalekama’s wedding dress which her family obtained in trade with the Dharovin. Its enchanted nature preserves it in like-new condition.

Mummy  
* Headdress of platinum set with nine black opals (2,500 GP)
* Ring of Freedom of Movement (Level 15)

Although the runes on the sarcophagus are not a curse, they do invoke the protection of Lady Death, who will frown on the violation of her faithful servant’s repose. Any character who participates in the plunder of this chamber will suffer a -2 penalty on the next death saving throw he makes.
