## Actions

**Multiattack.** The bog wight makes two claw attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one claw attack.

**Claw.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20 ft./60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Life Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Bog Wights** are the undead corpses of humanoids that arise in swampy areas permeated with necrotic energy -- often because they were lured by will-o-wisps or similar creatures into quicksand or similar hazards. A bog wight resembles a bloated, waterlogged zombie, but it moves much quicker and can swim just as quickly. Bog wights also employ intelligent tactics. A favorite trick is for the wight to submerge itself in murky water near a path where its intended victims will tread and use its tremorsense to choose the right moment to emerge and attack by surprise. Crafty fey such as hags commonly use bog wights to guard swampy approaches to their lairs.
