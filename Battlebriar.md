**Grasping Thorns.** Creatures the battlebriar is hostile to treat the area within 10 feet of the battlebriar as difficult terrain. Any creature hostile to the battlebriar within 10 feet of the battle briar at the start of the creature’s turn takes 6 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, freeing itself or another restrained creature within reach on a success.

**Threatening Reach.** A battlebriar can make opportunity attacks against all enemies within its reach (10 feet).

**Siege Monster.** The battlebriar deals double damage to objects and structures.

**False Appearance.** While the battlebriar is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal briar hedge.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The battlebriar makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17), and the battlebriar uses its Engulf on it.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning and piercing damage.

**Thorn Burst.** The battlebriar fires a burst of razor-sharp thorns in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (8d4 + 6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Engulf.** The battlebriar engulfs a Large or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the battlebriar’s turns or take 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the battlebriar moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The battlebriar can only have one Large, two Medium, four Small, or eight Tiny creatures engulfed at a time.

**Battlebriars** are deadly intelligent and mobile plants purposefully grown to serve in military capacities. They can destroy massed formations of lesser troops, storm defended embankments, and bring down fortifications. They can survive like plants do and thus make excellent eternal guardians. However, battlebriars have been known to run amok in combat, especially when seriously damaged by fire.
