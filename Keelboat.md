## Actions

**Multiattack.** The keelboat makes one shortbow attack for each band of crew not occupied with the ship's movement. The keelboat cannot multiattack on the round it makes a ram attack. 

**Ram.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 5 ft., one target (hull only) 0° forward. _Hit:_ 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage for each 10 ft. of relative speed. The attacking ship takes half of the damage dealt to the target.

**Shortbow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.

**Shortbow (flaming arrow).** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target (band only). _Hit:_ 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.

A keelboat is a small, single-masted sailing vessel that can also row or sail down rivers (thanks to its shallow draft and flat bottom). A keelboat’s main method of attack is with small arms distributed to the crew, as the ship itself is typically unarmed. Keelboats have poor speed, poor hit points and average Seaworthiness.
