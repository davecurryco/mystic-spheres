**Diabolic Eminence.** As a bonus action, the high priest can expend a spell slot to cause its melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If the high priest expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

**Abjure Fiend.** As an action, the high priest abjures infernal creatures (those with the _fiend_ keyword). Each fiend within 30 feet that can see or hear the priest must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is abjured for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. An abjured creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the priest as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the priest. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

**Dismiss Fiend.** When a fiend fails its saving throw against the priest’s _Abjure Fiend_ feature, the fiend must immediately return to its home plane if its challenge rating is at or below CR 7. If the fiend cannot return to its home plane, it is instantly destroyed on the plane it is currently on.

**Command Fiend.** When a fiend fails its saving throw against the high priest’s _Abjure Fiend_ feature, the priest can choose to charm the fiend, rather than dismiss it, if the fiend's challenge rating is at or below CR 7. While the priest maintains concentration, the charmed fiend becomes friendly to the priest and his companions for up to 1 hour. It obeys any commands the priest issues to it (no action required by the priest), as long as they don’t violate its alignment. If the priest’s concentration is broken, the fiend doesn’t disappear. Instead, the priest loses control of the fiend, it becomes hostile toward the priest and his companions, and it will probably attack. An uncontrolled fiend can no longer be abjured or dismissed by the priest, and it disappears 1 hour after it was first abjured.

**Spellcasting.** The high priest is a 10th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The high priest has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): _guidance, minor darkness, resistance, thaumaturgy, unholy flame_  
1st level (4 slots): _bane, inflict wounds, protection from evil and good_  
2nd level (3 slots): _blindness/deafness, spiritual weapon_  
3rd level (3 slots): _bestow curse, dispel magic, magic circle_  
4th level (3 slots): _banishment, beacon of despair, freedom of movement_  
5th level (2 slots): _geas, planar binding_

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The priest makes two quarterstaff attacks.

**+3 Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage or 10 (1d8 + 6) if wielded two-handed.

## Items

**Staff of Hellfire**  
_Staff, unique (requires attunement by a High Priest of the Black Fane)_

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. You have resistance to fire and necrotic damage while you hold the staff.

The staff has 9 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: burning hands (1 charge), fire shield (3 charges), or wreath of hellfire (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 +3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed. If any creature other than a High Priest of the Black Fane attempts to attune to the staff, it will erupt in hellish flames. The creature holding the staff when this happens will take 1d10 fire damage for each charge in the staff and must make a Dexterity saving throw against DC 15 or be transported to a random infernal plane.

## Malarynn's Lair

Malarynn's lair is the Fane of Blackfane Spire.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties) the High Priest of the Fane takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* The high priest creates darkness as though he had cast the darkness spell. The darkness lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
* If the high priest is standing within the circle inscribed around the altar, he can create a zone of evil influence as if he had cast hallow on the center of the circle.
* The high priest summons a spectral figure from one of the three large tapestries that hang at the far end of the apse as if he had cast guardian of faith (except that the guardian does necrotic damage instead of radiant damage).

### Lair Effects
If the high priest is standing inside the magic circle in the apse, he can maintain more than one spell or effect that requires concentration.

**Malarynn** is an Ophari nobleman whose ruthless quest for power and status took a turn for evil when he was recruited as an acolyte of the Black Fane. His abilities and natural sense of command enabled him to rise through the ranks to the very pinnacle of the order. Malarynn is an old man -- one-hundred and forty-two years old, to be exact. He looks every day of it, but among the damnable rituals he conducts is one that slowly drains a human victim of life-energy to lend the priest a blasphemous vitality. It is largely on account of the vampiric character of his existence that Malarynn and his patroness, Tyriana, understand each other much better than an elf and a mortal generally would.
