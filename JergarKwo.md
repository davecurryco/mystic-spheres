On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the mage takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the archmage can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The mage can close or open the entry to a _mordenkainen's magnificent mansion_ cast by its master.  
- While inside the extradimensional space of a _mansion_ cast by its master, one creature the mage can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be expelled from the extra dimensional space into the open spaces nearest the entrance.

(Romance, Cowardly, Handsome)

**Jergar Kwo** is Jaman Khal's apprentice. He is a capable wizard in his own right and is the heir apparent to the Jaman identity. He is every bit as anxious to defeat Xenadria as is his master since he knows that he will eventually have to deal with her himself.

Jergar is in his late twenties. He fancies himself a ladies' man and his greatest weakness is for a pretty face. He has more than his share of success on this score, for he is good-looking and charming. He does not, however, possess even the smallest bit of personal courage.
