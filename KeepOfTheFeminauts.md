# Keep of the Feminauts (goz-Leucia)

The people of ni-Shuba took over the site of the dwarven stronghold Hazad-druul for use as a base for their Aerazon corps. They repaired the walls with the labor of their men-slaves and established a temple to Asher-ai. In the cliffs east of the stronghold, there are many roosts for the quetzalcoatlus dinosaurs that serve the Aerazons as mounts.
