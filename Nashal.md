Grasping, Plutocracy, Dragonfly, Monotheistic

## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Plutocracy

Nashal is governed by Council, the _Dharam_ composed of the wealthiest citizens. Four of the 16 members of the Dharam are replaced every other year in an election in which only large landowners and wealthy merchants are electors. The Dharam chooses a Chief Minister, the _Kazeer_, who serves as an executive officer over the city-state's bureaucracy. A Chief Commander, the _Wazreem_, leads the army and is in charge of the mercenary and auxiliary forces, which have their own leaders.

As might be expected, the government of Nashal is mostly concerned with keeping wealth and power in the hands of the wealthy and powerful. The Dharam is particularly concerned that the _Ramad Lethshanar_ movement that has arisen in Neunazar might spread. Accordingly, the leaders of Nashal have given refuge to the remant of Neunazar's aristocracy and its exiled supporters. They have raised taxes on the commoners to raise a mercenary army to wage war against Neunazar, ostensibly to restore its monarchy.

## Religion

**Religion:** Monotheistic

The people of Nashal worship Elezzar, the merchant god, exclusively. Devotees of Elezzar contend that, although the existence of other gods cannot be denied, only their deity, in his many aspects, is truly concerned with the affairs of humankind. They view the worship of other gods as a foolish waste of time and resources. The deluded followers of other gods are tolerated, but temples and shrines to gods other than Elezzar are not permitted to be built anywhere in the city-state.

An underground cult of Molor, the god of greed, operates within the official worship of Elezzar.

**Magic Trader:** Biri's Exotic Oddities (Atrocious), Proprieter: Biri az Maaha bal-Fahai (M, 34, Khemez, druid, NE, Amusement, Malicious, Blue-eyed)

Occasionally, when he hears that likely marks are in town, the proprieter of Biri's Exotic Oddities will set up a ragged tent in the streets to display his wares. Biri, whose real name is Amitam Jasari, was apprenticed to a village shaman in Khanashar, but grew bored of the rustic life and spent a short career adventuring before deciding that it was safer to peddle gems, knick-knacks, and magic goods in the city. His goods, which he obtains from shady adventurer types and sells at 10-40% of the normal price, are of dubious quality. The gems are 80% likely to have flaws that lower their worth from 1-100%, the knick-knacks are 20% likely to break for each day of handling, the weapons are 50% likely to shatter on an attack roll of a natural 1 or 20, and the magic items have a 30% chance to produce a random effect from the Wild Magic Surge table _(PHB 104)_ instead of the usual effect each time they are used.

_Goods:_ 16 Pole(10-foot); 9 Blanket; 20 Tankard; 4 Signal whistle; 6 Tinderbox; 8 Gems (common); 1 Ring (simple, enchanted with Magic Aura)

**Magic Armorer:** Dragonhide Armory (Medium) Ud'ni Mutaa (M, 29, Kwanshali, barbarian, LN, Friendship, Sincere, Marked)

Ud'ni is a former slave whose master left him a sum of money on his death. With this bequest, Ud'ni set up this armorer's shop. He has a minor talent for magic, which manifests in an ability to repair magic armor. This, and his reputation for friendliness and honesty, makes Dragonhide Armory a hub of the trade -- fair goods for a fair price. Ud'ni bears the marks of his tribal origins (a band of ritual scars on his forehead) and his slavery (a slave-trader's brand on the back of his neck).

###### House Ni

**Patriarch:** Ry'aq Bahy bal-Ni (M, 42, Ahlrain, noble, NG, Destiny, Fanciful, Bloodshot)

Although it is one of the smaller noble houses, Ry'aq believes that House Ni been appointed by Elezzar to ascend above all others and produce a ruler who will supplant the Dharam. Unfortunately for his ambitions, he is more of a dreamer than a machinator. He is prone to wine-fueled, late-night discussions with his counselors and syncophants and is often hung-over the next day as he tries to conduct business.

**Heir:** Sa'ni bal-Ni (M, 28, Ahlrain, knight, NG, Experimentation, Haughty, Olive)

Sa'ni's father has groomed him for leadership since he was a boy. He brims with confidence and authority. In him, his father's fanciful streak is manifested in an active imagination. Unlike Ry'aq, however, Sa'ni energetically puts his ideas into practice. The downside of his upbringing is that Sa'ni often comes off as entitled and imperious. Nevertheless, he is a superb horseman, an expert swordsman, and a brave fighter. He capably leads the soldiers of his father's house in the service of their city-state and they all revere him. Despite his youth, Sa'ni is an experienced campaigner and outdoorsman, as can be seen by the wear on his fine gear and the dark tan of his skin.
