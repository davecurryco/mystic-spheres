# Withering Veil

_6th-level chthonic_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of natron)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

An magical curtain forms a vertical transparent wall up to 20 feet long, 20 feet high, and tissue-thin. The veil remains in place for the duration. If you position the veil so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature or object, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.

The veil is almost invisible and will be noticed only by a successful a Wisdom(Perception) check against your spell DC. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through the veil without harm.

When a creature attempts to physically reach into or pass through the veil, it finds that its way is blocked and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 13 (3d8) necrotic damage. The target continues to take this damage at the start of its turn for the next two turns, or until magical healing is applied. In addition, the limb that touched the veil withers and blackens. This has no effect on the function of the limb, but if the affected limb is a hand and the target has ever committed an act of murder, the spell has the same effect as the ritual used to create a **chthonic claw** (living claw). A withered limb can be restored by a _greater restoration_ or similar magic of the same or higher level.

You can choose to allow creatures or objects with specified observable characteristics to pass the veil in either direction without triggering its effects and without disturbing it.

The veil can be destroyed by a _heal_ or a similar spell of equal or higher level that restores hit points. A _rod of cancellation_ destroys a _withering veil_ and an _antimagic field_ temporarily suppresses its effects.

When you cast this spell, you must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be afflicted with a short-term madness.
