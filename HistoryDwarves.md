# Dwarven History

## Timeline

Dwarves of the Northern Kindred count the years from the founding of the city of Ahrazad. They refer to this count as _Karan Marzabul_, meaning Years of Reckoning or _Marzabul_ for short. Dwarven scribes usually write dates in the form 13020 M.

Dwarves of the Southern Kindred use a count called _Karan Krandul_ that observes the War of the Kindred as the beginning of an epoch. This system divides the years as being _Farad-Krandul_ (Before the War) and _Balun-Krandul_ (After the War). Dwarven scribes usually abbreviate this in the fashion F.K. 1025 and B.K. 12095.

## Major Events


### The Sundering of the Kindreds

The gemstone that was to become known as [HeartOfAbbathor](HeartOfAbbathor.md) was discovered by dwarven miners thousands of years ago in a vein of a strange, brittle ore at the roots of _Karad Nazarizim_, the Mountain of Mysteries. The enormous green stone was of no known type of gem and its shape defied normal geometry. It was claimed by King Dwairin II and given to Fearar son of Frar, the most skilled jewel smith of his time, to cut, mount and enchant.

Unfortunately, contemplating the alien geometry of the stone's crystalline structure drove the gem cutter mad. Convinced that the patterns formed a key by which the secrets of the elements might be revealed, Fearar was seized with the desire to keep it for himself. As he knew that this was impossible while Dwairin claimed the gem, the jeweler audaciously determined to overthrow the King.

Fearar drew on all his skill and lore to tap the arcane energies embedded in the stone and craft it into a jewel of power. He tuned the facets of the gem to reflect and amplify desires, especially those of dwarves, and bend them to the will of its wielder. Thus armed with the power to dominate others, the gem cutter fomented a rebellion against his sovereign and set himself in his place.

The gem might give its owner the power to achieve rulership, but it could not confer the skills to govern. After a few years of disastrous misrule, Fearar was himself overthrown. Boldir son of Brar, a charismatic young noble at the center of the plot to restore the throne to Dwairin's son, assassinated Fearar and in so doing came into possession of the gem.

Boldir fancied the ladies. His good looks, high status in the court of Dwairin III, and mastery of the gem led him to ever-higher conquests. He eventually seduced most of the ladies of Dwairin's court and the King's entire harem, including, in one memorable night, the Queen and her two daughters. Since dwarves marry to seal alliances between families, clans and even kingdoms, the ramifications of Boldir's misdeeds led to a civil war that sundered the dwarves into two kindred, North and South.

### The Rise of the Great Halls

In the days of the Azruun Empire, the dwarves of the Southern Kindred prospered. Wealth flowed like a river along the great road along the Ganshir Pass between the powerful dwarven cities of Sheurazak and Shalenharazd. Billets of copper, tin, iron, silver and gold dug from the mountain mines of Rothannur were carried to Sheurazak to be refined and traded. A constant stream of caravans conveyed the metals to Shalenharazad to be crafted into goods ranging from shovel-blades to jeweled crowns and sent down the Orumrhon river to the city of Dalanur to be traded in Hannenuar and the South Kingdoms.

The diplomacy of Glar Shrewdtongue, King of the Mountain Halls, kept the clans at peace and the trade flowing. His son Glarin ascended to the chieftaincy of the Mhenazher, The Forge Clan, after him. Called "Glarin Tightfist" for his grasping, miserly character, King Glarin did not expand the influence of his clan or the power of Sheurazak during his time, but neither did he diminish them. The dwarves of the Southern Kindred had all that that life requires and a great deal more, yet never so much as greed demands.

### The Corruption of Angrim

Amid turmoil and bloodshed, Frearar's gem passed from one ill-fated owner to the next. Always it seemed to corrupt the wielder's deepest desire into a blind obsession that, once achieved through the gem's power, was almost immediately lost. Although its possessors usually tried to keep it secret, the gem gained an evil reputation. Among the initiates of the hidden lore of the dwarves, it came to be called "The Heart of Abbathor", a metaphorical association that became actual when the jewel came into the possession of Angrim, a high-priest of the God of Greed.

Angrim dreamed of raising the Temple of Abbathor at Sheurazak to be the pinnacle of power and glory of dwarven civilization. Twisted by the gem's corruptive influence, the priest's ambitions led him to gain sway over King Glarin and his court.

### The War of Shadowed Halls

Under the influence of Glarin's court, the dwarves of Sheurazak became greedy, materialistic and self-absorbed. Worship of the God of Wealth took on an unbalanced character and Glarin's government became increasingly corrupt. The city soon became infamous for its grasping, callous materialism. In this environment, scruples fell aside in the relentless pressure to get ahead. Increasingly, the wealthy became wealthier and the poor more oppressed. The cult of Abbathor demanded more and more control over the lives and finances of its adherents. The king levied ever more burdensome and creative taxes to keep up the majesty of state and to fund an increasingly bloated bureaucracy. Lawsuits multiplied and rival families and businesses resorted to underhanded and even murderous tactics. Ambitious or desperate dwarves forged pacts with infernal or elemental powers, swearing themselves and their families to service. Competing agendas fostered rivalries. Alliances formed and were broken almost daily. The stakes were high and the only players left at the table were sharps and crooks. It was only a matter of time before someone went too far.

Fearing Angrim's growing power, Glarin set a subtle trap. After carefully staging a series of events designed to give the impression that he was under supernatural coercion, the King granted the High Priest the power to levy a direct tax on the income of the wealthy families in order to finance the construction of a new Temple. The King calculated correctly that the priestly tax-collectors would go to unreasonable lengths to ferret out every copper piece and, in so doing, would engender resentment against the cult of Abbathor among the powerful merchant class. Angrim's sinister reputation, based as it was in his actual and none-too-subtle use of the powers of his gem, deflected blame from the king. Soon, it was whispered that Angrim had bewitched Glarin and was the actual instigator of the unpopular tax.

Faced with ruin and convinced that the King was incapable of resisting the High Priest's demands, a group of merchant princes formed a secret society they named The Order of the Crucible. With their combined material and magical resources, they brought about Angrim's assassination and overthrew the influence of the cult of Abbathor in Glarin's court. Once again, the green gem had enabled its owner to achieve his deepest desire, only to have it snatched away almost immediately.

The priests of the God of Greed ritually embalmed their fallen leader according to his instructions and, fearing the apparent curse on the green gem, buried it with him. Even they were reluctant to live under Angrimâ€™s despotism for centuries to come and thus they placed runes of binding on his sarcophagus to prevent his mummy from rising in undeath. Threatened with extinction, the priests of Abbathor threw their wealth and influence into a campaign to reclaim their status and wreak revenge on the merchants of The Cruicible. This resulted in a series of assassinations and reprisals known as _Krandul-Morakunmaror_, The War of the Shadowed Halls, that drew in factions on each side and threatened to escalate into another civil war.

### The Destruction of Sheurazak

In the midst of the factional infighting came The Cataclysm, which destroyed the elven Kinglom of Asariel, many leagues to the north. However, a few days later, a series of powerful earthquakes collapsed much of the underground city of Sheurazak. During this crisis, Glarin was chiefly concerned with securing the treasury and his own personal fortune. He showed little concern for the welfare of his people. In an infamous incident, Glarin diverted critical resources away from efforts to rescue a holy woman and her pupils in order to secure valuables from the palace. Challenged by an advisor, Glarin defended this decision, saying, "Let Sehaine look to her charges and I will look to mine."

In the wake of the destruction, many dwarves came to believe that the earthquakes were a punishment by the gods in judgement of the materialism of their society. Glarin became the scapegoat for these sentiments. He and the Mhenazher lost sway and the clans each went their own way. Glarin eventually lost control even of his own clan and died in exile among the Northern Kindred. With much of the underground city dangerously unstable and in fear of further quakes, Sheurazak was soon completely abandoned.

The Cataclysm also destroyed the Azakenazer Gorge Bridge and effaced much of the Ganshir Pass road in landslides. With the Azruun Empire and Sheurazak in ruins and the major trade route closed, the flow of trade to Shalenharazad stopped. Now, refugees, not gold, streamed in. The dwarves of the once-great city were reduced to poverty. Many left Shalenharazad to live among the rustic clans of the mountain mines or to seek their fortunes in the lands of the north.

### The Invasion of Shalenharazad

As the lands of Rothannur became wilder, the goblins multiplied and grew bold. They occupied the mountains of the Ganshir Pass west of the Azakenazer Gorge. Centuries after the Cataclysm, goblin warriors led by the chieftain Hruggrush threw down the Sunset Guard of Shalenharazad and took the Western Halls in the Battle of the Silver Caves, _Khzud-Illunrhur_. Only the sacrificial last stand of a company of dwarven soldiers at the Chasm Stair, a crucial junction, saved the Eastern Halls from being overrun.

### The State of the Southern Kindred

Many years after these events, the dwarves of Rothannur have remained scattered. Although in pockets of strength such as Zerengar some clans have begun to reverse their misfortunes, the dwarves are still beleaguered.  Goblins occupy the Western Halls of Shalenharazad, despite several attempts to dislodge them. Travel along the Ganshir Pass is unsafe and even well-armed expeditions sent to explore the ruins of Sheurazak have never returned.
