## Ethnography

The _Kwanshali_ barbarians who live along the Kalakiri river are divided into warring tribes. Along the barren coast, the tribes are less populous, but more fierce, being cannibals for the most part. The population of the towns and cities and the traders who travel along the roads between are of the same ethnicity, but are civilized. Still, the Kwanshali are given to tribalism.
