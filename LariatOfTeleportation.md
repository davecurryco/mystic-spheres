# Lariat of Teleportation

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This 20-foot long rope is plaited from strips of unicorn rawhide and tied into a lariat. You can take an action to throw the loop of the lariat over yourself or another creature up to 10' away to cast the spell _teleport_ on the target. If the creature is unwilling, you must successfully make a ranged weapon attack on the target. The lariat stays with the creature holding the rope end. It can't be used in this way again until the next noon.
