## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Plutocracy

Nashal is governed by Council, the _Dharam_ composed of the wealthiest citizens. Four of the 16 members of the Dharam are replaced every other year in an election in which only large landowners and wealthy merchants are electors. The Dharam chooses a Chief Minister, the _Kazeer_, who serves as an executive officer over the city-state's bureaucracy. A Chief Commander, the _Wazreem_, leads the army and is in charge of the mercenary and auxiliary forces, which have their own leaders.

As might be expected, the government of Nashal is mostly concerned with keeping wealth and power in the hands of the wealthy and powerful. The Dharam is particularly concerned that the _Ramad Lethshanar_ movement that has arisen in Neunazar might spread. Accordingly, the leaders of Nashal have given refuge to the remant of Neunazar's aristocracy and its exiled supporters. They have raised taxes on the commoners to raise a mercenary army to wage war against Neunazar, ostensibly to restore its monarchy.

## Religion

**Religion:** Monotheistic

The people of Nashal worship Elezzar, the merchant god, exclusively. Devotees of Elezzar contend that, although the existence of other gods cannot be denied, only their deity, in his many aspects, is truly concerned with the affairs of humankind. They view the worship of other gods as a foolish waste of time and resources. The deluded followers of other gods are tolerated, but temples and shrines to gods other than Elezzar are not permitted to be built anywhere in the city-state.

An underground cult of Molor, the god of greed, operates within the official worship of Elezzar.
