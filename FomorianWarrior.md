**Charge.** If the fomorian warrior moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a greatsword attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) slashing damage. If the target is a creature that is huge or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Berserk Rage.** Whenever the fomorian warrior starts its turn with 65 hit points or fewer, it enters a berserk rage. On each of its turns while berserk, the fomorian attacks the nearest foe it can see and reach. While berserk, the fomorian eschews ranged attacks and suffers a -2 penalty to its armor class, but does maximum weapon dice damage with its melee attacks. If no foe is near enough to move to and attack, the fomorian attacks the nearest visible creature it can. If no creature is near enough, the fomorian attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the fomorian goes berserk, it continues in this way until it is reduced to 0 hit points or it regains hit points sufficient to bring its total to 100 hit points or more.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The fomorian warrior makes two greatsword attacks.

**Greatsword.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 30 (6d6 + 9) slashing damage.

**Rock.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

**Curse of the Maiming Strike (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** When the fomorian warrior hits a creature with a melee attack, as a bonus action, the fomorian can magically force the creature to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed with magical deformities in addition to the damage it suffers from the hit. While deformed, the creature has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attacks based on Strength or Dexterity.
The transformed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on a success.

**Fomorian Warriors** are recruited from those formorians whose deformities are not physically disabling. They usually make up for it in extra measure of hideousness in their appearance and vileness in their temperament. These elite fighters are usually found in the service of formorian nobles, who equip them with fine armor and weapons from the forges of the most cunning smiths among the dark dwarves. Fomorian warriors are trained by mercenary giants and this training tempers their chaotic nature somewhat.
