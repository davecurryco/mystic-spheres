**Ariel Evasion.** If the shrike is flying and is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dex saving throw to take only half damage, the shrike instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and half if she fails.

**Flyby.** The shrike doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when she flies out of an enemy's reach.  

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** The shrike deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the shrike that isn’t incapacitated and the shrike doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The shrike makes two melee attacks or two ranged attacks. The shrike can use her Net of Entanglement in place of two of the attacks.

**Throwing Iron.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft. (or 90/360 ft. with a height advantage of 50 ft. or more), one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage or 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage with a height advantage of 50 ft. or more, plus 13 (3d8) fire damage.

**Net of Entanglement.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 5/15 (or 15/45 ft. with a height advantage of 10 ft. or more), one target. _Hit:_ A Large or smaller creature is restrained until freed. The shrike can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a command word. A target restrained by the net can use an action to make a DC 17 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the net.  
The net has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the net drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.  

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, plus 13 (3d8) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The poison lasts until it is removed by the _lesser restoration_ spell or similar magic.

**Shriek of Doom (Recharge 5-6).** The shrike emits sonic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 54 (12d8) force damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Shrikes** are equisitely thin, pale-skinned women with large owl-like, black-feathered wings. Their hair is long and glossy black, but their faces are sharp-featured, twisted masks of vengeance and cruelty beneath a crown of seven small ivory horns, wickedly sharp. They move with astonishing grace and agility, especially in the air. They typically attack by surprise from above, hurling white-hot throwing irons or nets woven from their own hair. These weapons are energized by the shrike's intense hatred and lose their magical properties when she dies.  

**Mortal Origins.** Shrikes are easily mistaken for demons, but they are actually moral women transformed by a eldritch curse.
