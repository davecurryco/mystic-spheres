# Cosmology

The creatures of the campaign world understand the universe according to a cosmology that is, in its essentials, shared among all intelligent races.

## The Fundaments

The _Fundaments_ consist of four _Elements_ (Earth, Air, Water and Fire), two _Energies_ (Positive and Negative), and two _Abstracts_ (Space and Time). The Elements and Energies react in harmony or in opposition to each other within the matrix of the Abstracts. Magic is the manipulation of these interactions, usually through the application of will. Arcane lore generally characterizes the interactions between the Fundaments according to Affinities, Opposites, and Orientations. Magical traditions also associate Colors and even Emotions with the Fundaments. The conventional understanding of these is as follows:

| Fundament | Affinity        | Opposite | Orientation | Color      | Emotion      |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Positive  | Water, Air      | Negative | North       | White      | Elation      |
| Negative  | Earth, Fire     | Positive | South       | Black      | Gloom        |
| Earth     | Negative, Fire  | Air      | Northwest   | Brown      | Stability    |
| Fire      | Negative, Earth | Water    | Northeast   | Red        | Creativity   |
| Water     | Positive, Air   | Fire     | Southwest   | Dark Blue  | Calm         |
| Air       | Positive, Water | Earth    | Southeast   | Light Blue | Restlessness |

This may be summarized by a hexagonal diagram, which is a common symbol in arcane lore:

--P--  
E---F  
W---A  
--N--  

It is usual for the Abstracts to be represented by interlaced triangles connecting the symbols in this diagram.

## The Spheres

The _Spheres_ are durable interactions among the Fundaments where places and creatures can exist. Countless spheres exist in the universe, each in its own space and time. Clusters of spheres intersect with each other seemingly at random, like clusters of soap bubbles. The spheres of the campaign world are one such cluster among a myriad of other clusters.

## The Planes

The known spheres and their intersections with each other are relatively stable. This has led many scholars to think of them as layers referred to as _Planes_. Each plane has affinities with two or more fundaments. The interactions between these dominant fundaments determines the character of the plane. The exceptions are the Material Plane, Tears, in which all the fundaments are more or less balanced, and Ctholos, the Far Realm, which exists altogether outside the laws that govern the rest of the universe.
