# Reliquary of Arkraz Khalhazra

_Unique item, artifact (requires attunement by a cleric of evil alignment)_

The _Reliquary of Arkraz Khalhazra_ is a small box of polished ebony, plain except for a carved border featuring a motif of skulls and hearts. Sealed inside is an ancient relic, the thigh-bone of an infamous lich named Arkraz Khalharzra, which has been incised with runes of dark sorcery.

**Random Properties.** The _reliquary_ has the following random properties:

* 1 minor detrimental property  
* 1 major detrimental property  

**Command Undead.** While you are attuned to the reliquary and holding it, you can use an action to cast the _dominate monster_ spell on an undead target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next midnight.

**Raise Undead.** If the remains of a humanoid dead for less than a century are within 10 feet of the reliquary for a continuous period of time, the creature will rise as a humanoid undead with a challenge rating equal to or less than that which it had while alive -- up to CR 13. The amount of time needed increases with the creature's challenge level (4 rounds per level) and length of time it has been dead (1 hour per year). The basic form of the creature is not changed and missing or decayed body parts are not restored. This may mean that the type of undead is limited to one that has a limited corporeal form or none at all.

The reliquary's influence can affect the remains of only one creature at a time. If the remains of multiple creatures are in range, they will rise as undead in ascending order of challenge rating. Undead so created are masterless and free-willed within the limits of their capabilities.   

**Destroying the Reliquary.** The _reliquary_ has AC 10, 10 hit points, resistance to piercing, cold, fire, and lightning damage, and immunity to necrotic damage. If it is destroyed, it will crumble to a powder, which, if mixed with human blood and consumed within 3 turns, will poison the consumer for 4d12 + 24 hours. While poisoned, the creature must make a  Constitution saving throw each hour (save DC 18). The creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. While poisioned, the creature is vulnerable to radiant damage and cannot benefit from natural or magical healing or regeneration. If the creature dies, its body crumbles into an identical powder and its spirit is trapped on the Material Plane as a **spectre**. If the powder is not consumed within 3 turns, it will swirl up like a dust-devil and disappear -- to re-form the reliquary at a random location on the Material Plane after 7 days. If the creature lives through the poisoning, the reliquary is forever destroyed and the creature gains permanent resistance to necrotic damage.
