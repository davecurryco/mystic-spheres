## 3: Barrow of Sughulok-akar (Azruun Battlelord)

_Unoccupied and plundered_

Sughulok-akar was the son of a great Azruun warlord. He was promoted to general based on this connection. His incompetence as a tactician led to one of the Azruun Empire's more crushing defeats in the entire campaign of Asarial. Set up and ambushed by a strong force of elves, Sugholok-akar was killed along with several legions of his soldiers. His father entombed him in lavish style in this dolmen, but placed few magical wards on it because the Azruun position seemed very strong by the time the tomb was complete.

Untypically, Sugholok-akar stayed dead. Pentalya left his embalmed corpse untouched, but took all the rest of the treasure she could find. However, the hag missed a few secret chambers that still contain a good deal of wealth.

### Appearance

This barrow features two entrances fronted in well-cut gray granite.

### Left Entrance

This entrance is still sealed with a massive stone door which has been finished smooth and incised with a border of Azruun runes. The door is not locked, but it is very heavy (Strength DC 27 to open).

Inside, a passageway six feet high opens onto a small chamber eight feet high and continues on the other side. On the left side of the chamber stands a small shrine of black-stained wood on which is set a small golden figurine of a hooded and cloaked humanoid figure with claw-like fingernails and bat wings. The face of the figure cannot be seen. There are two golden lamps on either side of the figurine, but these are unlit.

The shrine is just a decoy made of flimsy, gilded wood. The entire chamber is a trap intended to kill or disable intruders:

Collapsing Ceiling Level 13 Lurker

Hazard XP 800

Someone steps on a trigger plate on the floor and the ceiling falls in, covering the room in rubble.

Hazard: When triggered, a false ceiling filled with rocks and debris falls from above to fill the area with attacks.

Perception  
DC 26: The character sees that the ceiling appears to be constructed of stone tiles.  
DC 31: The character notices the trigger-plates hidden in the stone flags of the floor.  

Additional Skill: Dungeoneering  
DC 21: The character sees that the ceiling appears to be constructed of stone tiles.  

Trigger  
When a creature steps on one of the trigger-plates, each ceiling square attacks the area beneath it.

Attack  
Standard Action Close burst 1 centered on the chamber  
Targets: All creatures in burst  
Attack: +16 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 3d12 + 8 damage  
Miss: Half damage.  
Effect: The burst area becomes difficult terrain.  

Countermeasure  
An adjacent character can disable a trigger-plate with a Thievery DC 31 check.

### Right Entrance

This entrance is also closed off by a stone door essentially identical to the one in the Left Entrance. It is similarly difficult to open (Strength DC 27 to open).

### Antechamber

This chamber is lined in well-fitted, evenly-sized granite blocks of a light gray color. The arched ceiling is 10 feet high at its apex and is supported by pilasters on the left and right walls. The floor is covered in slate flags of alternating dark gray and rose sandstone. The far wall is decorated with an elaborate inlaid border featuring a repeating motif of skulls and double-bladed axes.

At the center of the room is a dry well twenty feet deep surrounded by a low wall of serpentine blocks two feet high. The skeletal remains of 9 female humans lie jumbled at the bottom, virgin sacrifices made to accompany Sughulok-akar into death.

### Servant Burial Chamber

An ornate portcullis of bronze blocks off the entrance to this chamber. It is only slightly affected by oxidation and is still strong. It is not locked, but neither does it have a mechanism for raising it (Strength DC 28 to lift).

The chamber itself is of the same construction as the Antechamber, except that its floor is a uniform dark gray. There is a niche in the wall on the side opposite from the entryway that contains a sarcophagus of dark-stained wood inlaid with a border featuring a repeated pattern of empty slots where precious inlays were ripped out. The lid of the sarcophagus has been removed and lies carelessly propped against the dais that supports the sarcophagus.

Along the walls, the skeletons of six warriors lie in heaps along with the rust and decay of their gear of war and the chains that bound them to their common doom. The remains have been disturbed and a discerning eye (Perception DC 14) will notice many vacant settings for gems and precious inlays on the ruins of sword-hilts, shield-bosses, and helms.

Inside the sarcophagus, the mummy of a particularly large warrior lies in disarray, having suffered the removal of its magic armor, helm, and sundry valuable ornaments.

### Offering Chamber

This relatively plain room is behind a closed door of rusted iron. The lock was rusted shut but has been forced open. The door was forced open as well, but it must be still opened by main strength (Strength DC 20 to open).

The room is strewn with a jumble of wood splinters, broken crockery and the smashed metal lids of urns -- all that remains of the treasure that was once buried here. However, a secret door on one wall (Perception DC 28 to find) conceals a hidden chamber in which the most precious of the burial offerings were cached:

* Chest: 3,100 GP; exquisite jade carving of a horse (5,000 GP)
* Chest: black fire opal (1,000 GP); Curseforged Scale Armor +3 (Lvl 13)

### Burial Chamber

The passage to this chamber is blocked by a solid slab of stone five feet thick on which is carved a circle of six skulls, each set in a recessed circle. This is a combination lock (Thievery DC 33 to open). Pressing a skull will set its number and pressing it again will unset it. The combination is 1-3-5 (the odd numbers being considered auspicious in Azruun culture). If the lock is defeated or the combination guessed, the slab will descend into the floor for 9 turns, after which it will rise again. There is no opening mechanism on the other side so it is easy to become trapped in the burial chamber unless the party takes precautions such as leaving a large, crush-proof object on top of the slab.

The burial chamber itself is lined in slabs of greenish granite and floored in flags of polished serpentine. A black marble sarcophagus stands in the center of the room, flanked by two large red-granite statues of birds of prey.

The sarcophagus is elaborately decorated with borders of runes interspersed with stylized skulls and double-bladed battle axes. The lid has been unsealed (Perception DC 14), but has been replaced. Inside, the mummy of Sughulok-akar lies in disorder, having been thoroughly rifled for valuables.

The statues can be moved on their bases toward the center of the chamber (Thievery DC 20 to discover; Strength DC 30 to move) to expose two burial-pits beneath them. In the right pit is the skeleton of Sughulok-akar's favorite horse, still in its gold-ornamented saddle (620 GP) and bridle (230 GP). In the left pit are the skeletal remains of his two wives, along with their jewelry (enameled gold and turquoise necklace 300 GP; jade necklace 250 GP; enameled gold and turquoise bracelet 120 GP; gold and jade bracelet 80 GP; gold and amethyst brooch 220 GP; gold anklet 80 GP; assorted gold piercing studs and rings 130 GP).

## 4 Barrow of Ranzer (Azruun Shadowlord)

_Occupied and plundered_

Ranzer was a powerful sorcerer who specialized in shadow-magic. In one of her first combats against the Azruun war-wizards, Lianniel confronted Ranzer and overthrew him, but was forced to withdraw from the field to deal with a crisis elsewhere. The Azruun enbalmed Ranzer's body using special rituals to allow Narastur to access the Shadowlord’s knowledge even in death by touching the mummy’s lips with an enchanted jade token. They entombed the mummy in this dolmen, surrounded by grave-offerings appropriate to his station.

Centuries after the fall of Asarial, the token came into Pentalya's possession. She was able to use it to find the location of his tomb. It was this information that first led her to the barrows. After she stripped all the wealth of the dolmen, Pentalya used the token to oblige the dead Shadowlord to instruct her in dark magic. However, a translation error had led her to insert the token in the mummy’s mouth, instead of merely touching its lips. This mistake permanently animated the Shadowlord’s corpse. After she had learned all she could, the hag re-sealed the tomb with a magical ward to prevent others from accessing its secrets.

### Appearance

This oblong barrow stands alone on a barren, east-facing slope. The mound is a little higher than that of the other single-tier dolmens. No grass grows on the mound, only low, creeping weeds and thorn bushes.

### Entrance

The entrance to the dolmen is built of large, well-fashioned blocks of black basalt. The lintel is a single, massive piece of stone carved with a stylized design of a vulture with wings spread. In the vulture's claws, a circle of runes spells out "Ranzer, Lord of Shadows".

The door is a thick slab of black basalt. It is carved with a border of runes around a square inset featuring the device of a black sun (an eclipse). The black sun is a seal that must be rotated to unlock the door (Thievery DC 28 to open). The door is also locked with an Arcane Lock ritual cast by Pentalya (Strength/Thievery DC ??).

### Sacrificial Chamber

This small chamber is lined in dark gray slate. At its far wall, the skeletons of three women lie in heaps beneath the rusted chains that once shackled them to the wall. The remains have been rifled and a number of bones have been carelessly tossed aside.

The spirits of these poor wretches linger in this room as trap haunts. The circumstances of their deaths have combined with the ambient dark magic in this barrow to give these ghosts a special ability: each trap haunt can teleport a creature it has possessed into one of the sets of shackles on the wall. Creatures so restrained are considered immobilized until freed (Strength DC 30).

3 Trap Haunts (Level 8 Lurker)

Any altercation in this room will be likely to draw shadows from the Antechamber.

### Antechamber

This unlit room is lined in black granite and the floor is covered in flags of the same material. The ceiling is arched and supported by black marble caryatid pillars carved in the shape of rampant wyverns. At one end of the chamber a well faced with black marble tiles gapes flush to the floor. A bone-chilling cold issues from the well and permeates the room. If the adventurers have a light source, they will observe that a fog creeps from the well and lightly obscures visibility in the room.

The well is immeasurably deep, as it is a portal to the sphere of Shadow. One turn after living creatures enter this chamber, shadows will begin to flock here and emerge from the well, hiding among the shadows cast by the wyvern caryatids to attack when it seems most advantageous.

7 Shadow Stalkers

5 Shadow Stranglers

3 Shadow Puppeteers

The stranglers will tend to attack first, using Devouring Dark to blind as many of their foes as possible. They will then target the most vulnerable-looking member of the party with Strangling Darkness. The puppeteer will usually follow with a Shadow Puppet directed against the strongest-looking of the adventurers. Each stalker will try to use Shadow Stalk as soon as possible, but if its attack does not succeed it will retreat into the shadows to wait for an enemy to fall to 0 hit points so that it can try again.

### Main Hall

This hallway is floored in dark gray slate and lined in similar-colored granite. The entrance of the hallway is blocked by an portcullis. It is only a little rusted, due to the dry, cold air. The lock has been broken so the portcullis can now be raised by lifting it (Strength DC 23).

In the middle of the hall, there are passages to the left and right. At its end is a cast-iron statue of a wyvern. This was once a form of iron guardian, but it was disenchanted by the necromancer. However, its inner mechanisms are still intact. Although the statue is no longer magical and is not a trap, if the wyvern’s jaws are forced open, it will release a gas that will fill the hall:

Life Eater Haze (Level 22 Obstacle)

Hazard XP 4,150

With a violent hiss, billows of blue-tinted purple gas fills the room. Each gasp of the vile stuff drains your strength and saps your life essence.

Hazard: This strange gas steals the life from those within it.

Perception  
- It takes no check to see the gas.

Additional Skill: Arcana  
- DC 24: The character recognizes the life-draining traits of the haze.  

Trigger  
When a living creature starts its turn in the gas, the gas makes the following attack.

Attack - Necrotic, Poison  
Opportunity Action - Area the entire room  
Target: Each living creature that starts its turn in the gas  
Attack: +23 vs. Fortitude  
Hit: 1d10 + 6 poison damage, and ongoing 10 necrotic damage (save ends). First Failed Saving Throw: The ongoing damage increases to 15 necrotic. Second Failed Saving Throw: The target loses a healing surge.  

Countermeasures  
- Making a close or an area attack that has the radiant keyword nullifies the haze in the affected squares until the end of the attacker's next turn (or, in the case of a zone, until the zone ends). Those who start their turns in nullified areas are not attacked.  

### Offering Chamber

The chamber to the right of the main hall was once filled with grave offerings, but it was plundered. Several large ceramic amphorae that were once filled with fine wine lay overturned in the far corner. Only a little dark residue hints at their former contents. There are several opened chests that contain jumbles of clothing and footwear made of wool, leather, and silk, but all are too deteriorated with age to be of any use. There were other goods here as well, but everything of any value was taken.

### Sacrificial Chamber

This chamber is lined in dark gray granite and the floor is covered in slabs of the same stone. At one end stands a rough, black stone about six feet high and two feet wide. There are iron rings affixed to either side near the base and a similar ring is attached to the back approximately three feet above the floor. In a corner is a wide well lined in black granite. It is 20 feet deep and the bones and skulls of a number of humans cover the bottom. A stone staircase climbs up one side of the wall.

Ranzer's bodyguard, concubines and personal servants were strangled at the pillar one-by-one and their bodies were cast down the well. Their skeletons lie at the bottom of the well, but their bodies were stripped as part of the sacrificial ritual so there are no valuables. Their spirits are normally quiescent, but they are bound by a curse that allows Ranzer to summon them as a standard action if he is adjacent to the pillar.

4 Ghost Concubines (Level 13 Controller)
2 Ghost Legionnaires (Level 13 Soldier)
6 Phantom Warriors (Level 4 Soldier)

### Burial Chamber

At the top of the stairs, a short passageway leads to a black granite door carved with the same black sun design seen on the entrance door. The door is three feet thick and is locked with no visible means to open it except perhaps the black sun design:

Sigil of Life Draining Level 13 Obstacle

Trap XP 800

You press your hand on the strange design and it radiates negative energy. You find that you cannot withdraw your hand as you feel your vitality being drained away.

Trap: The only way to open a portal warded by this trap is to press the sigil itself with the bare hand of a living creature. The trap will immediately attack.

Perception  
DC 17: The character notices that the design is hand-sized and is recessed into the surface of the door in a way that suggests that it can be pressed.  

Additional Skill: Arcana  
DC 23: The character recognizes that the door cannot be opened except by pressing the symbol with a living hand.  
DC 31: The character’s knowledge provides a +2 bonus to Fortitude against the trap's attack.  

Trigger  
When the sigil is pressed with the bare hand of a living creature, the trap attacks immediately and attacks again each round at the beginning of the target's turn.  

Attack  
Opportunity Action Melee  
Target: Creature touching the sigil  
Attack: +18 vs. Fortitude. Each time the attack hits, the target's effective Fortitude weakens by -2. This penalty is cumulative. Fortitude lost in this way can only be restored by a Cure Affliction or an extended rest (at the rate of 1 point of Fortitude for each 8 hours rest).  
Hit: 3d10 + 6 necrotic and psychic damage and stunned until the end of the target’s next turn. A stunned target cannot withdraw its hand from the sigil.  
Miss: Half damage and dazed until the end of the target's next turn.  

Countermeasures  
It should occur to any genuinely evil character that the hand pressed to the sigil need not be his own.

The chamber itself is of well-dressed stone, plastered and painted in geometric borders incorporating Azruun runes and the skull and axe motif found elsewhere in this dolmen. Between the borders, frescoes depict Ranzer’s mastery over various creatures of the nether planes. The floor and ceiling are of polished jet. To the right and left, magic circles are inset into the floor in silver. The circles bind two apolliths, demonic creatures of the shadow plane bound to guard the Shadowlord in death. At the far end of the chamber, Ranzer’s mummified corpse sits on a gilded and enameled throne, hands clutching a black ironwood staff to its chest. On either side of the throne, chests decorated in the same manner as the throne once held offerings, but these have been plundered. However, one of the chests has a false bottom (Thievery DC 23 to find), beneath which is hidden the cover of the Codex of Narastur. This was placed here by Pentalya, who located and recovered it by means of information gleaned in part from Ranzer, but dared not keep it in her possession while the deceased Shadowlord knew she had found it.

Mummy Shadowlord (Level 17 Elite Controller) - Ranzer

2 Apolliths (Level 15 Elite Controller)

As soon as any creature enters the room, the mummy’s eyes will blaze with purple-black fire and the apolliths will swirl to alert. The mummy shadowlord will wait in silence for one round. The apolliths will defend the mummy and his treasures, but cannot leave their magic circles.

If commanded to speak, Ranzer will ask, “What is it that you would know?” The command must be issued in the Azruun tongue, but may be phrased in any manner. The mummy will not respond to any phrase other than a command to speak. If no such command is issued in one round, Ranzer will attack any intruders in the room or in the hall outside it.

Ranzer’s spirit is bound to the mummy and is constrained to answer questions on demand. It retains the knowledge and cunning the Shadowloard accumulated in life, but is detached from the concerns of mortal existence. All that remains of Ranzer’s personality and drive is his evil, which he will display amply if aroused. Ranzer will attack intruders with all resources available to him and will choose tactics intelligently. If bloodied, the mummy will use Escape into Shadows to disengage and will retreat down the stairs.

Unless he is detected, Ranzer will stop at the pillar in the Sacrifice Chamber to call forth the spirits of his guardians. He will then retreat to the Antechamber, pausing on his way to trigger the gas and drop the portcullis in the Main Hall if time permits. Once at the Well of Shadows, Ranzer will call forth a shadow kraken. If there is combat in the Antechamber, any surviving shadows will emerge from the well to join in, hoping to liberate one of the character’s shadows.

Shadow Kraken (Level 15 Solo Soldier)

If the shadow kraken is reduced to 100 hit points or less, it will retreat back to the Well of Shadows. As a final act of malice, it will pull down several of the caryatid columns in the Antechamber, causing the ceiling to collapse:

Collapsing Ceiling Level 13 Lurker

Hazard XP 800

The ceiling falls in, covering the room in rubble.

Hazard: Rocks and debris fall from above to fill the area with attacks.

Perception  
DC 21: The character sees that the ceiling appears to be unstable.  

Additional Skill: Dungeoneering  
DC 26: The character sees that the caryatid columns supporting the arches that hold up the ceiling could be toppled by a sufficient application of force.  

Trigger  
When a creature topples two or more columns (Strength DC 30), each ceiling square in a burst 1 radius centered on the column square attacks the area beneath it. For the next 3 rounds, the ceiling squares will attack on a roll of 4-6 on a d6.

Attack  
Standard Action Close burst 1 centered on the toppled column  
Targets: All creatures in burst  
Attack: +16 vs. Reflex  
Hit: 3d8 + 8 damage  
Miss: Half damage.  
Effect: The burst area becomes difficult terrain.  

Countermeasure  
Characters can use various means to prevent a creature from toppling the columns necessary to trigger the trap.
