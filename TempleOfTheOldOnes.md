_Map:_ [Temple of the Old Ones Map - Levels 2 & 3](LahoorTempleOfTheOldOnesMap_2.pdf)

The materials, construction, and architecture of this building are unlike anything else in the city. It is built with large blocks of greenish stone set without mortar so precisely that it is impossible to force even a knife-blade between them, despite their obvious antiquity. The interior walls are of the same construction. The halls and chambers are windowless and unlit, without any provision for lamps, cressets, or even torch-holders. Except in the larger chambers, there are no arches and even those are reticulated. Although the architecture features rectangular shapes, the angles are seldom square. Instead, the architects seem to have favored tricks with perspective to prompt a sense of awe and unease -- heightened by the stifling atmosphere and sense of incredible ancientness.

A number of magical effects in the temple can inflict short-term or long-term madness on a character. If the number of times a character is so afflicted while in the temple exceeds 2 plus the character's Wisdom or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher), the character acquires an indefinite madness. 

## Level 1

### 1A) Entry Portico

The stone above the entryway is decorated with a weathered bas-relief frieze. It depicts a group of unsettlingly alien humanoids engaged in acts that may be interpreted as homage to a central group of much larger figures that look like a cross between a lamprey and a squid. The capitals of the two columns are sculpted as the heads of three squid-like creatures whose tentacles snake down the pillars to a base carved in the form of humans crushed and writhing beneath an oppressive load.

### 1B) Entry Hall

Mud from seasonal flooding cakes the floor of the hall for the first twenty feet, but strangely does not extend beyond this even though the hall slopes down once it gets past the passageways to the flanking chambers. A successful DC 10 Wisdom(Perception) check will find the footprints of numerous sahuagin in the mud and tracking into the hall and passageways.

The passageways were once hung with curtains which have rotted away, leaving behind only the heavily-oxidized bronze curtain rods and rings.

### 1C) Vestibule

The mud extends 10 feet into this chamber, which is otherwise empty.

### 1D) Mural Room

The curtains of this room have disentigrated like the curtains in the hallway. The west wall was once decorated with a mural depicting the emergence of the Old Ones from the Sea of Chaos, but the paint has all but vanished.

### 1E) The Spider's Lair

A **giant spider** lurks at the end of this room among the bones and skulls of its victims -- mostly large lizards.

### 1F) The Guard Chamber

The dessicated corpse of a sahuagin lies before the curtain on the other side of this room. The curtain itself has not decayed. It is a heavy affair of thick silk brocade woven in disturbing patterns of dark purple on a dark red background. The brass rings and curtain rod are untarnished.

A **poison gas trap** triggered by magnets concealed inside the curtain rings guards the curtained doorway. It is well hidden -- Wisdom(Perception) DC 16 to detect. Once detected, an Intelligence(Investigation) DC 16 check will reveal tiny holes concealed amid the carved ornamentation of the doorway. If triggered, the trap will fill the room with a poisonous gas, which will linger for 1d6 turns. Any creature that starts its turn in the area of effect must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and is rendered unconscious for 1d6 rounds. A creature unconscious in this way automatically fails subsequent saves for additional damage, but the duration of unconsciousness is not changed. 

### 1G) The Throne Chamber

The curtain of this room is intact and is identical ot the one to the Guard Chamber. The room is empty except for a throne made of demon bones, teeth, and horns bound with platinum wire to a hidden frame of welded adamantine rods.

A creature with an Intelligence above 4 that begins its turn sitting in the throne must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is incapacitated and experiences a terrifying vision that inflicts 3d6 psychic damage and short-term madness.

### 1H) The Fossil Chamber

In the center of this room is what appears to be a statue of an alien creature sculpted from serpentine in minute detail. The creature is eight feet tall and has an oblong body that is hexogonal in cross-section. At the base of the body are three stubby tentacles, which may be described as feet by their function if not their appearance. At the crown is a three-cornered mouth fringed with fine tentacles and ringed with rows of sharp, pointed teeth. Three quarters of the way up on each of the creature's six sides is a small bat-like wing over which is a bulbous eye with a triangular pupil. The hide of the creature's body has a pebbled surface, while the tentacles and wings are repulsively smooth.

The statue is actually a kind of fossil created in a failed attempt to summon an Old One. It radiates magic, but is otherwise completely inert. An attempt to "restore" the creature to life by means of _stone to flesh_ or similar magic will result in an explosion of a noisome slime akin to rotten whale blubber. All creatures in a 20-foot radius of the statue when this happens must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is poisoned for 4 rounds minus a number of rounds equal the the target's Constitution modifier. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated as it is violently ill. On recovery, the target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. A failure of this second saving throw afflicts the target with a short-term madness.

### 1I) The Chaos Well

This room is empty and featureless except for a circular pool 10 feet in diameter flush with the floor in the center of the chamber. The borders of the pool are incised with an intricate design remniscent of interwined tentacles. The pool seems to be filled almost to the brim with a substance like mercury, except that its surface is shiny and reflective, rather than dull.

The substance in the pool is actually a **chaos wierd** summoned here to serve as a combination guardian and cover for the Chaos Well. If the chaos wierd is killed, the fact that the "pool" is actually a shaft of unfathomable depth will be revealed once the planar rift closes. In (d10 + 4) rounds, a **neothelid**, attracted by the appearance of the rift, will crawl up the shaft from one of its myriad side-tunnels and attack anyone still in the chamber with its tentacles. The abberation will retreat back down the shaft as soon as it has swallowed a victim. 

### 1J) Hall of the Crocodiles

The east wall of this hallway is carved with a bas-relief depicting a procession of creatures that have human bodies and crocodilian heads. The creatures wear kilts and broad collars and bear staves or curved swords. At the head of the procession, a larger figure wearing an elaborate headdress bears a small coffer.

### 1K) The Prison of Kyusryss

At the end of this room is a slab of translucent pink stone of the same dimensions as a sarcophagus. It is ornately carved in an intricate geometric motif, but of a disturbingly non-Euclidean sort. 

The slab is an extradimensional prison -- much like those associated with the _imprison_ spell, except that it holds its inmates in a non-material form as charges of arcane energy trapped among the crystalline lattice of the stone. The stone imprisons a number of ancient enemies of the cult of the Old Ones, but the secret by which they may be released is long lost. No force can damage the prison while the spell lasts.

A creature with an Intelligence score of at least 4 that spends at least one round contemplating the slab must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and is afflicted with a short-term madness due to horror at the uncanny nature of the object.

### 1L) Vestibule

This chamber is empty, except for the mud and debris on the floor that extends 10 feet into the room.  

### 1M) The Pit

From the entryway the room appears empty, but a powerful chanel odor wafts from it into the adjoining chamber. On a successful DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check, a character will notice that the floor is entirely free of the dirt and debris found in the adjoining rooms.

This entire room is a **pit trap**. The floor is an illusion covering a pit 20 feet deep. Jagged, pale-green crystals with razor-sharp edges grow on the floor of the pit. The rotting corpse of a sahuagin lies at the bottom, along with the bones of a number of less-recent victims. A creature that enters the room must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and an additional 13 (3d8) piercing damage. A creature that starts its turn in the pit having taken piercing damage from the crystals must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a successful DC 14 Wisdom(Perception) check, a character can see through the illusion.

### 1N) The Obsidian Mirror

An oddly-cut slab of black stone is mounted in a niche in the south wall of this chamber. It's surface is polished to such a degree that it acts as a mirror. However, if a character spends more than 1 round looking in it, he will see his reflection become clouded over -- after which the clouds will dissipate to reveal a vast star-scape full of unfamiliar constellations. Other than to give the viewer a vague sense of unease, the mirror has no other effect, as its intended use as a communication portal between worlds depends on a ritual that was lost centuries ago.

## Level 2

### 2A) The Great Hall

This wide hallway slopes down past three portals on the left and one on the right. The posts and lintels of the portals are ornamented with carved borders featuring a motif in which horrified men and women are entwined in masses of intertwined tentacles. 

### 2B) The Great Vestibule

The ceiling of this large chamber is barely 10 feet high. The north and south walls are covered by massive curtains of black silk woven in an intricate, but irregular, texture. The posts between the portals on the east wall are carved in the shape of plants, or perhaps creatures, with winding tendrils that end in saw-toothed leaflets and bulbous pods, obscenely dehiscent. 

### 2C) The Assembly Chamber

The overall post and lintel architecture of the building reaches its zenith in this, the largest of the temple's chambers. The untarnished bronze doors are unlocked and may be easily opened by means of ornate pulls wrought in the shape of monsters of the deeps. The doors, pillars, capitals, and architraves are decorated with intricate bas-relief work, the intertwined patters of which have an insidious effect on the mind.

There are ten doorways in the walls of the chamber, only three of which are occupied by actual doors that lead to adjoining chambers. The other seven are occupied by doorways that open onto portals to other places, planes, and even dimensions. All the doors share the property that, when closed, their doorways do not exist in the place the door opens onto. The doors open inward to the chamber and close of their own accord in three rounds unless held open. The doors in order clockwise around the room are:

**Door 1:** Exit to the Great Vestibule

**Door 2:** Portal to Tolengul. This door opens on a dark alley in the city of Tolengul.

**Door 3:** Portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire. A blast of heat like that of an oven scorches a 5 foot area when this door is opened. This doorway opens on an island in a bay of a great lava sea, the Sea of Fire. On the heights of a promontory that juts into the bay, the spires of the fabled City of Brass shine in the the flickering aurora of flame that eternally lights the sky.

**Door 4:** Portal to the Deeps of Space. When this door is opened, a freezing blast extends into the room. Creatures within 5 feet of the door must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept into the void of space.

**Door 5:** Exit to 2P  

**Door 6:** Portal to the Mountains of Kulzigal. This door opens on a high mountain pass in Kulzigal. Snow swirls into the room from the blizzard raging beyond the doorway.

**Door 7:** Portal to the Drowned City. This door opens on a wall of dark blue water, suprising a school of fish, which turn as one creatre and dash away. Beyond the doorway, a collonade of pillars, ruined and encrusted with marine life, marches away into the dark depths.  

**Door 8:** Portal to Limbo. The door opens on a scene of unimaginable chaos. A great slab of rock, like the prow of a ship, extends from the doorway above a oily-surfaced lake that bubbles and seethes. Above this, a hillock of blue crystals floats in the orange sky. Lightning plays between the facets of the tower-sized crystals. Suddenly, the lake freezes over with greenish-blue ice, which immediately cracks into myriad shards which melt and fall upward like a reverse rainstorm, leaving a vast crater floored with hardened lava behind. Simultaneously, the floating blue crystals turn a dull, gray, metallic hue and break off to plunge into the bed of the former lake. These spikes then are transformed into tall forms like trees, which then catch fire and burn like torches as the sky darkens to an angry charcoal gray through which hurtle meteors of diamond. 

**Door 9:** Portal to Minarous. A feotid stench pervades the area of the doorway as soon as the door is opened. The doorway looks out over a vast, stinking bog under a brown sky that drizzles an acid rain that collects in oily pools and drains away in rivulets between the blasted stumps of once-mighty trees. Across a yawning chasm at the top of a cliff of sharp-edged flint is a giant-sized citadel with walls of weathered, rust-red stone.

**Door 10:** This door opens on a blank wall, the stones of which are cracked and blasted. This is actually an illusion placed on the entranceway to the Catacombs.

### 2D) The Catacombs

The north door of this low-ceiling, wide hallway is made of stone and fits flush with the stone frame of the archway. The door is smooth and plain except for a circular recess at its center. Within the recess, a seal of soft silver-grey metal covers the bronze latch. The seal bears the Symbol of the Keeper within a circle of inscribed hieroglyphics. Anyone who breaks the seal must make a DC 18 Constitution save or be affected by a rotting curse. An affected creature loses 3d6 hit points from its hit point maximum and 1d4 points of Charisma. The effects are permanent unless cured by a _greater restoration_ or similar magic. 

The door to the Assembly Chamber is exactly the same as its counterpart in the chamber. It too opens on a blank wall, but a DC 11 Wisdom(Perception) check will reveal that objects or creatures can pass through the wall into the next room. This effect is due to what is effectively a permanent, one-way _passwall_ spell.   

The west wall is honeycombed with 18 crypts, each of which is sealed by a serpentinite marker carved with strange designs and characters of an unknown script. A character that uses _Comprehend Languages_ or similar magic to understand the writings must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is afflicted with a short-term madness due to the blasphemous names carved on the markers.

Most of the crypts hold the mummified remains of a cultist or cult leader -- some of which were interred with wealth. Each crypt takes 1d3 minutes to open with a successful DC 12 skill check with thieves' tools. Undead have Individual Treasure according to their CR, while mummified corpses have Individual Treasure of CR 2d4 (roll again for results where the treasure is in cp). Traps are Wisdom(Perception) DC 15 to find and Intelligence(Investigation) DC 15 to disable.

One of the undead sealed within the crypts bears the Token of the Bearer, a medallion of meteoric iron on a thick chain of the same material. The medallion is fashioned in the shape of a flat, blobbish monstrosity with a central, sucker-like mouth surrounded by seven bulging eyes at the bases of seven writhing tentacles.

### 2E) Crypt of the Keeper

The door to the crypt seems to have been cast in one piece from a strange, purplish metal. It fits tightly into its stone frame and has no pulls, handles, or locks. The door is decorated in bas-relief in the semblance of a nightmarish monstrosity -- a squamous mass flanked by tentacles and clusters of eyes and split by a gaping mouth from which protrude long, daggerlike, interlocking teeth. A successful DC 20 Wisdom(Perception) check by a character inspecting the door within 5 feet of it will reveal that teeth are caked with dark stains.

The door is a magical construct, a **guardian portal**. If a creature touches the door, it will animate and attack.

Beyond the door is a small, richly decorated antechamber. Everything is pristine, as though it were newly-made. The floors are black marble and the ceiling is covered in ceramic tiles glazed with lapis lazuli. Slender, gilded columns of cedarwood stand in each corner, supporting architraves of the same material. The walls are covered in frescoes depicting bizarre hyrids of human and crocodile or human and snake in acts of homage to larger creatures who are themselves hybrids with heads like birds of prey, black-skinned human torsos and arms, snakelike lower bodies, and black-feathered wings.

In the center of the chamber is a obelisk-like pedestal of alabaster four feet high carved on all four sides with an inscription in a bizarre, flowing script. The script is written in an extinct language, but _comprehend languages_ or similar magic will reveal that it reads:

_May that which is hidden stay concealed and they who are asleep, may they wake not. In the name of Yaggoth and of Geb-Asar and of Nyalzarid of the Void may these things be until the Day Appointed._ 

The peak of the obelisk is flat and is covered by a hollow crystal pyramid, beneath which is a fist-sized lump of rock, black and pitted, but glittering with flecks of greenish-silver metal. The crystal cover is not trapped and can be easily lifted from the pedistal. The rock does not radiate magic, but it is far heavier (20 lbs.) than its size would suggest. This is because it is actually a meteorite containing _abditumite_, an extra-terrestrial metal. A character that uses _detect magic_, _identify_ or similar divination magic on the rock must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds as the magic reverberates on itself in a sort of feedback squawk. A creature that carries or wears the rock cannot be targeted by _scry_ or similar divination magic. The pedestal and cover serve as a sort of amplifier for this effect, extending the protection from divination magic to a radius of 20 feet.

An archway in the southwest corner of the antechamber leads to the crypt. It has no door, but a thick curtain of green brocade with gold thread blocks the view. On the lintel of the archway is an inscription in the same script as found on the pedestal. It reads:

_In the name of Phrazon of the Dusk and of Ry'pnoth the Ancient, may the Crawling Curse be upon he who violates the Crypt of the Keeper._ 

Inside the green outer curtain hangs a veil that appears to be made of translucent shot silk in pale blue and green. The veil shimmers with its own pale light and its colors shift in an unsettling way. A successful DC 13 Wisdom(Perception) check reveals that the veil is not actually fabric, but some kind of supernatural effect. It is, in fact, a permanent _chthonic veil_ (DC 16; colors: blue, purple, orange). The veil will allow a creature bearing the Token of the Keeper to pass in either direction.

The crypt is furnished in even more splendor than the antechamber. Most of the frescoes depict more of the hybrid crocodile creatures engaged in arcane pursuits, but on the North wall, two of the hybrid bird creatures, a male and a female, are pictured standing on either side of a portal from which black rays emerge.

In the center of the crypt is a serpentinite dais decorated with inlay of gold and enamel on which a rests a translucent crystal sarcophagus. The figure within can be vaguely discerned when the sarcophagus is lit from behind. It is human in form, but has a flat head with a long snout. This is the Keeper, a Speaker to the Old Ones, who was entombed here as a **chthonic mummy** to await the proper alignment of the spheres to call them back from the Void Between the Stars. He's perfectly capable of defending himself in the meantime however. The rending of the _chthonic veil_ or any other desecration of the Crypt or its antechamber will bring the Keeper's spirit back from the Astral Plane, where it wanders. On the next round, the Keeper will attack, using its Horror Aura to get some space or _gaseous form_ (a bonus action) to exit the sarcophagus, which has vent-holes for just this purpose. 

In addition to his personal ornaments, the Keeper wears the Token of the Keeper, a medallion identical to the Token of the Bearer, except that it is made of platinum. This item is essential to the Keeper's special destiny and it will pursue anyone who takes it as far and as long as necessary to recover it.

_Treasure:_ Copper bowl (6 gp), Enameled gold collar (1,000 gp), Enameled gold crocodile mask (2,300 gp), Enameled gold wristlets (50 gp), Enameled gold belt (150 gp),  Gold inlaid ivory rod (900 gp), Amber (100 gp), 4 x Chrysoberyl (100 gp), 3 x Coral (100 gp), 3 x Garnet (100 gp), Jade (100 gp), 2 x Pearl (100 gp), 2 x Spinel (100 gp), Tourmaline (100 gp), Potion of Resistance (poison) (uncommon, dmg 188)

_Tome:_ The Chthonic Apocrypha of Zuri the Seer: _This folio is comprised of writings in an unknown script incised on thin sheets of platinum bound by platinum wire in cover of a strange, thick, greenish-brown leather covered in bumps and warts with platinum fittings. An individual who reads this tome, which requires 48 hours over a minimum of 6 days, gains a +3 bonus on Intelligence(Arcana) checks to identify aberrations. A humanoid creature other than an elf who reads this book must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw for each 12 hours of reading or be afflicted with a short-term madness. If the save fails by 5 or more, the madness is long-term instead. Creatures that suffer from such a madness have disadvantage on saving throws against psychic attacks made by abberations._

### 2F) Chamber of Murals

This room features a several murals. The colors are faded and the paint has flaked off in patches, but the artwork is still plainly discernable.

The mural on the diagonal wall depicts a bizarre city on a bluff overlooking a raging sea under a moonlight sky. Strangely, the city appears devoid of inhabitants.

Another large mural spans the north and east walls. Along the bottom, it depicts creatures with crocodilian heads and humanoid bodies engaged in everday activities such as weaving baskets, making bark cloth, and fishing from reed boats. A second band with a different background portrays the same creatures pursuing more elevated arts such as writing, carving monuments, and dancing. A third band, near the top, depicts more elaborately dressed crocodilians offering bloody sacrifices of unknown provinence at an ornate well-head, beneath which are depicted deep caverns and dark pools populated by worm-like beings with many tentacles and eyes.

### 2G) Chamber of Guardians

In this room, two statues of black stone occupy thrones of polished serpentinite along the north wall. The larger-than-life statues, which face south, are carved in the form of creatures with crocodilian heads and human bodies, one male and the other female. The carved figures wear elaborate headdresses and collars. The male wears a kilt and holds a curved sword and the female wears a close-fitting dress and holds a mirror. Although the work is not anatomically precise, both statues convey an attitude of watchfulness and forbiddance.

A creature that starts its turn in the room beneath the imperious gaze of the statues must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with awe and feelings of insignificance for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects. This used to be much more effective in the old days when this effect was coupled with the attack of a dozen or so guards.

### 2H) Gate Chamber

Three of the walls of this chamber are hung with a single floor-to-ceiling curtain of faded red silk with gold fringe. The material is so deteriorated that it can easily be ripped down from the patinated brass rings that secure it to a rail of the same metal fastened to the wall. This curtain conceals a locked (DC 16) bronze door that opens onto the stairway. The curtain also deadens echoes in the room.

In a large alcove in the north wall, a corbeled archway carved with a motif of twisted tentacles interlaced around skulls human and not-so-human opens onto a blank wall. Seven large, white gemstones are set in the keystone of the arch in a rather irregular patten. There is an empty socket near the center of the group that would hold another such gem the size of a woman's fist. A successful DC 18 Intelligence(Arcana) check will reveal that the gems are arranged in the same pattern as the stars of the constellation known in Khanashar as _Sencherb_, The Watcher.

If the quartz gem from the Keeper's canopic jar is placed in the empty socket, it will activate this portal, which opens on an otherwise inaccessable region of the Astral Plane adjacent to the Far Realm. This is the place to which the Keeper is meant to repair to invite the Old Ones into the world at the appointed time.

_Treasure:_ 7 x large Quartz (250 gp)

The stairway ascends to Level 4.

### 2I) Corridor of Pain

This entire corridor is a [Path of Flails](PathOfFlails.md) trap designed to slay intruders.

### 2J) Ritual chamber

This room was once used for rituals, including mummification. It is empty now except for a stone table at the center of the west wall and some broken ceramic urns in the southeast corner that once held natron, bitmen, and other chemicals used in mummification.

The walls of this chamber were once decorated with a fresco, but the plaster has long ago cracked and peeled so only splotches of faded color remain.

### 2K) Guard Chamber

Guards were once stationed in this room. The only remant of this use is a stone bench along the center section of the east wall.

### 2L) Antechamber

This room was once used as a common room for the cult priests and as a reception room for visitors. The remains of a low, oval, wooden table in the northwest corner is the only hint that remains.

### 2M) Hallway

The west wall of this hallway had a fresco, but this too has deteriorated beyond recognition.

### 2N) Priest's Cell

This room was the living quarters of a cult priest. An ancient, worm-eaten wooden bedframe in the north end of the room and an armoire in similarly sad shape in the south are all that remains.

Buried beneath a flagstone in the center of the floor of this cell is the canopic jar of the Keeper. This hiding place was not intended to be accessed and so it can only be found by a successful DC 30 Wisdom (Perception) check. The only clue is that the successive priests who dwelt in this room could not bring themselves to walk on the spot where the Keeper's relic lay and so this flagstone is less worn than the others surrounding it.

The Keeper's canopic jar is made of alabaster inlaid and footed with gold. A golden seal stamped with the Keeper's hieroglyph secures the lid. Inside, the Keeper's brain, shrunk to the size of a walnut, is preserved along with a huge, strangely faceted quartz gemstone (1,000 gp). This gem is the key to the portal in the Gate Chamber.

### 2O) High Priest's Quarters

The cult high priest lived here in the temple's heyday. This room was appointed in a rich, if macabre style. The furnishings were of higher quality and so have survived the centuries in better shape than elsewhere, but this merely gives evidence that the place has been ransacked. Dressers of laquered wood flank the north doorway. Their drawers have all been pulled out and several were smashed. A low writing desk in the southwest corner is overturned. However, the high priest's bedframe, a sinister-looking affair of black iron inlaid with silver, is in good condition, although the bedding has long since gone to dust. This is because the bedframe is enchanted. A creature that sleeps in this bed cannot be targeted by _dream_ or similar magic.

### 2P) High Priest's Study

This room was once used by the high priest as an antechamber and study. Like the High Priest's Quarters, the study has been ransacked long ago. A low, round table of laquered wood stands in the southeast corner and there is a writing-desk of similar height in the northwest corner. The moldered remains of leather-covered cushions lie about them. Two laquered wooden chests with patinated bronze fittings lie broken open and upended, one in the northeast corner and the other in the southwest. An overturned bronze brazier lies just north of a bronze door in the west wall. The door is locked and the lock mechanism is corroded (DC 20 Dexterity check with thieve's tools to open).  

A scroll cabinet, also of laquered wood, carven and gilded in unsettling designs, stands near the desk. Its locked doors were forced open and its shelves are empty. Rollers of wood and ivory litter the floor in front of it among the flaked and rotted remains of papyrus scrolls. The long-decayed corpse of a humanoid with a serpent-like head lies face-up on the floor in front of the shelves. His cloth kilt and leather belt are decayed, but a character who makes a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice that the belt has several straps that were apparently unfastened.  

## Level 3

### 3A) Sanctum

Curtains rotted. Evil altar.

### 3B) Staging Room

The stairwell beyond descends into a water-filled shaft.

### 3C) Fount Chamber

This chamber has a pyramidical, corbeled ceiling at the apex of which is a crystal that casts a dim, sickly-yellow light.

The southwest corner is occupied by an fountain of reddish porphyry carved in the form of a plant-like creature like those depicted in the pillars of the Great Vestibule. The fount's carved stamen trickle an oily, opalescent liquid into a "pitcher" at its base.

The liquid is actually **opal goo**.

At the bottom of the "pitcher" are the skeletal remains of the most recent of the opal goo's victims -- a small human female. Among the bones are the victim's jewelry.

_Treasure:_ Jade necklace (100 gp), Jade earplugs (50 gp), Jade girdle (150 gp), Jade headdress (200 gp)   

### 3D) Elevator 1

The interior of this chamber is a cage of bronze wrought in a fantastic openwork pattern. This is effectively an elevator car paired to an identical car in Elevator 2. The car is, by default, at the level of the south hallway. One turn after anyone enters the chamber, the room descends 20 feet over the course of two turns to the level of the north hallway. At the same time, the car in Elevator 2 ascends from its default position to its raised position. Once there are no creatures remaining in this car, it will ascend again -- at which time the car in Elevator 2 will descend.

The action of the elevator is driven by massive counterweights and magically-controlled gears behind the stone walls in the area between the chambers. A creature or object caught in the doorway when the elevator rises or descends will take 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage on the elevator's initiative (10) in each round. 

### 3E) West Sanctum

A huge chunk of meteoric rock riddled with holes occupies the center of the room. A **swarm of mind worms** inhabits the rock. The worms cannot leave the rock, but will use their ranged powers to assail any creature that comes into the room using their ranged attacks. The colony will not attack a creature that displays the Token of the Bearer or creatures in its company.

### 3F) East Sanctum

This room also contains a chunk of meteoric rock infested with mind worms. What significance there may be in the presence of these aberrant creatures and the strange separation of the two colonies may only be guessed at. 

### 3G) Elevator 2

The counterpart to Elevator 1.

### 3H) Chamber of the Stelae

At the center of this high-ceilinged chamber is a 10-foot tall stele of greenish stone shaped with odd angles and inscribed with hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue. Much of the script is effaced by the wear of long millinea, although it is unclear how that could have happened in its current protected location. A _comprehend languages_ or similar magic is required to read the words that can still be deciphered. Among them is this snippet:

_Beyond the Veil, the Ancient Ones await_  
_Their time, appointed by the stars of fate._  

_The Dead Gods spawning worlds within their dreams,_  
_As death to those of mortal compass seems._  

_That is not dead, which can eternal lie,_  
_And with strange eons, even death may die._  

Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the stele and can see the stele must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be affected as by a _symbol (insanity)_. A creature that displays the Token of the Bearer and any creature in its company automatically succeeds on this saving throw.  

### 3I) Librarium

The door of this chamber is made of bronze and is like those of the Assembly Hall, but it is unlocked. The interior walls of this small chamber are lined with bookcases and scroll-cabinets of red-lacquered wood, carven and gilded in unsettling designs. The shelves and cabinets are packed with the mouldered remains of books and scrolls.

A pedistal of black onyx stands in the center of the room. On it is a large, open book with black leather covers and bronze bindings. In front of the pedestal is a petrified human rogue. The rogue is apparently of the Alhrain race and wears classic adventuring gear. The look on his face is one of horror and surprise.

The pedistal is enchanted to protect any book placed on it. Any creature other than the book's owner that touches a book placed on the pedistal must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be instantly petrified. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

A band of apparently decorative hieroglyphs that runs along the top of the walls of the chamber actually forms a sort of Faraday cage for magic. Spells of 3rd level or less that originate from outside the room cannot affect objects or creatures inside the room and vice-versa.

Besides the book on the pedistal, a single scroll case survives among a jumble of rotted parchment in one of the scroll-cabinets.

_Tome:_ The Abyssal Manuscripts of Eadhas: _This libram is written upon vellum and bound in rowan wood covered in monstrous hide and trimmed with brass studded with tourmalines. It can only be opened with a drop of blood. Many of its pages are marked with indecipherable scrawls. This spellbook contains the spells Chthonic Veil, Etherealness, Finger of Death, Mirage Arcane, Plane Shift, Project Image, and Reverse Gravity._

_Scroll:_ The Apocryphal Scrolls of Umud: _These scrolls are locked within a case of ivory fitted with a silver clasp and silver hinges. This spellbook contains the spells Clone, Control Weather, Maze, Mind Blank, and Power Word Stun. It also contains Awaken Crystal, the ritual necessary to open the door to the Treasure Chamber._

## Level 4

### 4A) Treasure Chamber

The door to this chamber is a formidable-looking affair of bronze-adamantine alloy. Its surface is covered with bas-relief designs that are remniscent of the carapace and segmented legs of crabs and the encrustations of barnacles. At the center of the door is a large, oddly-faceted yellow-green crystal that glows with a sickly light. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal that the "decorations" are not simple bas-relief, but are separate components. They are, in fact, part of the mechanism that bolts the door.

The crystal is necrotite and it is the intended target of an Awaken Crystal ritual that must be cast to open the door. Once the crystal is awakened, it can be instructed to direct its energy to work the lock mechanism on the door. Otherwise, a DC 25 Wisdom(Perception) check will reveal that the crystal is both a trap and the key to opening the door. The crystal can be disarmed with a successful DC 30 Dexterity check with thieves' tools. An unsuccessful check causes the crystal to explode. Each creature in a 30 foot radius from the crystal when it explodes must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 55 (10d10) necrotic damage or half as much damage on a successful one. If the crystal explodes, the door cannot be opened by any means other than destroying it. Otherwise, the door can be opened by a successful DC 35 Dexterity check with thieves' tools. Failure on this check also causes the crystal to explode. 

The room is finished with tiles of dark stone, behind which a thin sheets of lead have been laid to prevent its contents from being scried. The room is bare except for a pedestal of pale orange crystal about 3 1/2 feet high and 18 inches wide. The crystal has many vertical facets and is jagged at the top. A chest fashioned from smooth black stone sits nestled in a slot carved in the top of the crystal. A band of curious symbols of an unknown language is carved around the circumference of the chest near its top. Otherwise, the chest is featureless -- without hinges, hasp, or lock. The chest is, of course, magically trapped. If the chest is disturbed in any way without first reciting the incantation printed on the band of symbols in a prescribed order, a cyclone of purple flame will erupt and swirl around the pedestal at the end of turn in which the chest was disturbed and in each of the next two rounds. Creatures within 5 feet of the pedestal (but not in the space of the pedestal itself) when the cyclone is active must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 55 (10d10) force damage or half as much damage on a successful one. Non-magical objects in the area of effect that aren't being worn or carried are disintegrated.    

_Treasure:_ 800 cp, 5000 sp, 2000 gp, 130 pp, Amethyst (100 gp), 2 x Coral (100 gp), 3 x Garnet (100 gp), Jet (100 gp), 2 x Pearl (100 gp), Spinel (100 gp), Spell Scroll (Planar Ally) (very rare, dmg 200)

_Tomes:_ The Demonic Esoterica of Thundu: _This set of cracking parchment manuscripts bound in a cover of basilisk hide is contained in a pewter coffer set with chrysoberyl. It is locked by magic, and can be opened only by tracing a pattern inscribed upon it. This spellbook contains the spells Antipathy/Sympathy, Clone, Demiplane, Maze, Imprison, and Telepathy. An arcane spellcaster who reads this tome, which requires 54 hours over a minimum of 8 days, gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against Fear and similar effects originating from fiends. A humanoid creature who reads this book must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw for each 12 hours of reading or attract the attention of a **succubus/incubus** that will begin to stalk the reader._

### 4B) Hall of Death

The door to this hallway is made of bronze with inscribed decorations. Suspiciously, it is entirely free of corrosion. The door is locked (Dexterity DC 18 with thieve's tools to open) and is also trapped. It actually pushes open, but false hinges and the presence of a door pull give the appearance that it is meant to be pulled open. If someone pulls the door pull, a hidden panel attached to the pull will open and release a **swarm of stygian darts**. These insect-like crystalline constructs attack as a swarm of wasps, except that their armor class is 16, their attacks are +6 to hit, and they have the same damage and condition immunities as a stone golem. In addition to the piercing damage, a creature that is hit by an attack from these constructs suffers 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

Inside the door, the entrance to the hall is protected by a _withering veil_ spell (DC 16). The spell will allow a single creature that bears the Token of the Keeper to pass.

The hall is guarded by an **unseen guardian** that has orders to attack any creature who enters the room unless the creature is a crocodilian that displays the Token of the Keeper. The guardian will wait invisibly until the intruder gets to the center of the hall, at which point it will slam the door closed to prevent escape and then attack on the next round.  

### 4C) Hall of Mysteries

This hall is filled with a purplish mist that heavily obscures vision beyond 5 feet. Vague whispers imparting insidious knowledge seem to come from various points in the room. Creatures that start their turns in the mist must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with a short-term madness.

### 4D) Inner Sanctum

The walls of this oddly-shaped room are decorated with frescoes depicting seven nightmarish monstrosities, each with a cartouche containing the name of an Old One. The Keeper is supposed to use the frescos to summon them when the stars are right, which won't be for another century or so. The frescos are enchanted with a spell of preservation which gives them a damage threshold of 5.

The names of the depicted Old Ones and their descriptions, in clockwise order from the west wall north of the entrance are:

**Ctha-Tureth** "The Crawling Menace" _An enormous, centipede-like monstrosity with a head like a snake's surrounded by a mane of writhing tentacles. Chta-Tureth is the progenitor of insidious evil that corrodes institutions from within._

**Nith-Shulhu** "He of the Thousand Eyes" _An amorphous cloud of motes of multi-colored light in which larger, white lights burn with focused intensity. Nith-Shulhu watches from the cold dark beyond the Veil, gathering information for unguessable purposes._

**Narth-Ghoggua** "The Mirror of Worlds" _A colossal, living crystal whose myriad facets reflect scenes from the infinite planes of reality. Narth-Ghoggua is the power-source of chthonic spells such as Awaken Crystal._

**Sha-Achath** "She Who Would Be Avenged" _A bloated, blue-skinned, bat-winged, faceless woman with hair like strands of kelp and infeasibly long claws of jagged obsidian. Sha-Achath is one of the few Old Ones that is depicted in a quasi-humanoid form, but she is somehow even more alien and repulsive for that. She plots impossibly-convoluted schemes to wreak havoc on mortal worlds in revenge for some unfathomable wrong and is utterly impervious to placation._

**Ktulzschoorla** "The Gibbering Chaos" _A shapeless blob of rubbery, pink flesh from which emerge staring eyes, gaping mouths, and writhing tendrils. Ktulzshoorla sees, speaks, and reaches into a myriad of planes simultaneously. Its many voices whisper, shriek, and babble ideas beyond rational understanding, mind-numbing inanities, and soul-blasting secrets. Ktulzshoorla's motivations, if it has any, are utterly unguessable amid the cacophony of its speech, the jumble of its interests, and the randomness of its actions._

**Zotha** "Traveler of the Void" _A gargantuan creature with a cigar-shaped body ringed by five moth-like wings and terminated at both ends by a shark-toothed maw surrounded by helical tendrils. Zotha flies through the cold dark of space at impossible speed on unfathomable errands, leaving a contrail of disrupted reality in its wake. Astronomers of many worlds have mistaken the approach of this elder being as that of an unknown comet, rightly identifying it as a portent of doom, but incalculably misapprehending the scope of that doom._

**Shee-Hoggua** "The Floating One" _A behemouth cogeries of myriad bubbles, each of which encapsulates a miniature world that spawns, lives, and expires in a brief space of seconds. It is said that each of these bubbles is an actual world of the multi-verse, but it is unclear what Shee-Hoggua's relationship to these worlds might be. Some say that the bubbles merely reflect a reality remote in time and space fro Shee-Hoggua's presence. Others say that Shee-Hoggua's presence continually creates new realities that are incredibly compressed in time and space. Whatever the truth may be, all who have studies such things agree that of all the Old Ones, Shee-Hoggua is the most benign -- and the most inscrutable._
