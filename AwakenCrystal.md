# Awaken Crystal

_4th-level chthonic (ritual only)_  

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** 5 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a crystal or gemstone worth at least 500 gp, which is destroyed in the casting of the ritual)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

You choose one object with a crystalline molecular structure, such as a chunk of ice, a lick of salt, a diamond, or a piece of quartz, which you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. The object can be no bigger than 1 cubic foot and can weigh no more than 200 lbs. The spell imbues the crystal with an alien sentience that has an Intelligence of 10 and senses similar to a human's along with telepathy 60 feet. The crystal does not gain the ability to move, but it may manipulate any energies with which it is imbued. For example, a crystal that naturally glows could use an action to not glow, or a gemstone that is the focus of an _imprisonment_ spell or a lich's _trap soul_ effect could use an action to free its prisoner.

The awakened crystal is absolutely obedient to your command for the duration.

When you cast this spell, you must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be imprisoned (as per the _imprisonment (minimus containment)_ spell) for the duration of the spell. While imprisoned, you can still command the awakened crystal, but it cannot free you.
