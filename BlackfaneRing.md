# Blackfane Ring

## Episode 1

### The Passage to Blightland

If the party makes their way past the guardians at the Crossing Grove, they can activate the portal as previously described:

_As you circle the dead tree, things around you seem to become progressively more dim in the haze. Suddenly, you feel a lurch as though you had stumbled on a hidden root. When you look up from the ground, you find that the haze has vanished. Above you, the clear night sky is filled with stars — more numerous and brilliant than you have ever seen them. However, the trees surrounding the grove seem somehow threatening and the ruins are more thickly overgrown with vines and creepers than you recall. A musty odor of decay permeates the dank air._

Once the adventurers have crossed over to Cymmyrion, they will be subject to ambush by a number of blights and shambling mounds that infest the area due to its lingering ambiance of dark fey magic. There are 6 **shambling mounds**, 24 **needle blights**, 52 **twig blights**, and 36 **vine blights** scattered around the Court. The party will initially blunder into 2d4 vine blights and 1d6 twig blights. The plant creatures will be joined by 0-2 shambling mounds, 1d4 needle blights, 1d6 vine blights and 1d8 twig blights each round until the party leaves the area or all the plant creatures are slain.

### Schemes and Schemers

Whether they know it or not, the adventurers figure in the schemes of Gothrog the Tyrant, who seeks to establish a number of crossings between the material world and Cymmyrion as part of a larger plan to assault Elyeanesse, the Pristine City. The first of these crossings, in the Trollfell Barrows, is already in place. The second, in Stonewatch Pass, was once active, but must be reestablished.

In preparation for this, Gothrog has ordered his vassals of the fey and mortal world to gather evil creatures under their sway and secretly assemble them near the crossings, ready to launch a surprise attack. Before she broke away from her patron Gothrog, Pentalya the Troll-Queen, once stood high in the Tyrant's favor for her service in the creation of the crossing at the Trollfell Barrows and for the strength of the force of ogres and trolls she commands. However, Gothrog was all too aware of the scheming nature of hags, so he raised up a rival for Pentalya in Tyriana, an elven vampiress of great power, cunning, and cruelty. Tyrianna is lieutenant in command of Blackfane Spire, Gothrog's stronghold in the region of Cymmyria that includes the former crossing to Stonewatch Pass. She has amassed a small army of vampire spawn and other fey undead bound to her service.

The next step for Tyriana is to open the crossing at the Crossing Grove. She has information that a sapling of Laessaedomon was planted somewhere in Faelyon and has formed a crossing to the mortal world somewhere in Essealona. The exact location of the sapling on either plane is hidden from her. She has sent spies into Deepwood to find it, but has had no success.

Tyriana’s interest in the sapling has come to the attention of the Order of the Briar, the secret society responsible for the planting of the sapling as part of a plot to kidnap King Allenar of Essealona. They are also aware of the party’s past travels to the realm of the Troll Queen and recent acquisition of the Sword of Kings. In the mistaken belief that the adventurers are on a quest to free Allenar, the Order will set obstacles and deadly traps in their way.

For her own part, Pentayla the Troll Queen is aware of the party's visit to Darkmoon Castle and subsequent attempts to enter Aelvalon by means of the Crossing Grove. She correctly reads the motives of the adventurers, but instead of moving to stop them, Pentalya schemes to manipulate them for her own ends.

Like Tyriana, the Troll Queen knows that the sapling exists, but does not know its exact location in either sphere. However, because of her better sources of information in the mortal world, Pentalya is almost certain that agents of the Order of the Briar originally transplanted the sapling. When her spies observed a group of Briar druids erecting characteristic magical barriers around the Crossing Grove, Pentayla sent two of her agents to kidnap one of them for questioning. However, the agents, a **succubus** named Xabriella and an **oni** named Iayuma, bungled the mission. Their prize, the head druid, fell into the hands of an unusually strong patrol of Tyriana’s undead creatures. Pentalya was furious at first, but, informed that the party was approaching the Crossing, recognized an opportunity to thwart or even destroy her old rival Tyriana and secure her own hold in the mortal world. With the characteristic resourcefulness of hags, the Troll Queen instructed her minions to act out new parts in a deception wrapped in truth.

### The Imposters

_You notice that the corpses of several men and women hang suspended from vines and creepers in the gnarled trees surrounding the grove. Their clothes are shredded, their pale torsos and limbs are covered in jagged gashes, and their faces are fixed in expressions of pain and horror, but there is no trace of blood to be seen on any of them._

_Just then, the air in the circle around the dead tree seems to shimmer like dust in the moonlight. Two wispy, humanoid forms appear and as they circle the tree they grow more substantial. Just as you recognize them as a man and a woman hooded, cloaked, and robed in brown, they hail you. With hands covered in a tattoo pattern of interlaced briars, the young woman throws back her hood to reveal a fair face wreathed in bronze-hued curls and set with eyes the color of the deep forest. Tears streak her freckled cheeks as she cries, “Oh brave heroes, you have vanquished these blasphemous creatures! Can you not help us?” pTo this, her short, stocky, balding companion, who bears similar tattoos adds, “I am called Thornrow and my fellow acolyte here is named Goodrall. Our company were ambushed by foul creatures from beyond the grave. All but we and our leader, Alluria, were slain and she swooned from some dark sorcery and was borne away. I say this to our shame, for we two fled back though the portal, seeing that even our masters were overmatched. Yet, some good may come of it, for we lived to seek your aid."_

The two “acolytes" will reveal that their party was on a mission to recover a sapling of a sacred tree, but will insist that the full details were known only to the chief druidess, Alluria, who they assume was taken away to the vampiress Tyriana’s stronghold, Blackfane Spire. The acolytes will claim that they have little other knowledge since their roles were those of menial servants to the higher-level druids. Even so, their story has a number of weak points. For example, if the acolytes fled back though the portal, how did they survive the menace of the black forest on the other side? Also, why would the Order of the Briar need to “recover” the sapling since they were the ones who transplanted it to begin with? Xabriella and Iayuma do not actually know the name of the abduced druidess and so were forced to make one up, a fatal flaw that must eventually be exposed if the party is successful in rescuing her. Most damningly, the briar tattoo is the mark of an initiate, not a mere acolyte, although it is unlikely that anyone in the party would know this. If questioned on any of these points, Thornrow and Goodrall will dissemble as best they can. They will immediately flee if their fabrication is exposed.

If the party accepts their story, Pentayla’s agents will offer to guide the party to Tyriana’s stronghold since they know the general direction in which it lies. In fact, Xabriella and Iayuma know quite well how to get to Blackfane Spire. Their real objective is to keep an eye on the adventurers and steer them into conflict with Tyriana. If possible, they are to discover the location of the sapling, and murder the high druidess before she can disclose the secret to anyone else. On the latter point, Pentalya pegs her hopes on the vampiress’ well-deserved reputation for cruelty — that is, that Tyriana will prefer to torture first and ask questions later.

### The Shadow Unicorns

_Although it was clear all night long, by dawn the sky is overcast with a uniform layer of clouds the color of tarnished silver. As the light grows, you see several large creatures standing silently a short distance from your camp. At first, they seem to be dark-colored horses, but you soon make out long horns on their foreheads. They might be unicorns, but for their glossy black coats and manes, cruelly jagged, curved horns, and glowing red eyes._

The creatures are a herd of six **shadow unicorns**, guardians of the Crossing. Alerted to the size and strength of the party, they sent the seventh of their number for reinforcements and will attempt to stall until these can arrive. Unless the party attacks immediately, their leader, a powerful and graceful mare named Nikra, will approach to within 60 feet of the foremost of the party and will say telepathically:

_"Who are you that you trespass here in the realm of Lady Tyriana? Begone, for her law is death to those who come hither without leave!"_

As she approaches, the others will fan out 70 feet behind her and level their horns, menacing a charge. This is a bluff, as the unicorns will all retreat to the Ethereal Plane immediately if they are attacked. Otherwise, Vikra will negotiate down as necessary to buy time:

* _"We are the border guard of Tyriana the Cruel, who all in this realm fear and obey. I am Vikra, leader of this war-herd, and I say to you, 'Turn back or we will quench our horns in your blood and tramp your bones beneath our hooves.'"_
* _"I see that you are strangers ignorant of Lady Tyriana's decree, else we would slay you out of hand. But you may not pass unless it is by her leave. It is our sworn duty to uphold this."_
* _"Betimes, Her Terrible Majesty may grant those who have entered her realm unbidden her permission to stay. But that authority is not given to me. Bide here a while and I will send a swift messenger to ask it."_
* _"It is said, 'The gilded palm opens many doors.' Our Lady delights in rare and wondrous tribute. What treasures can you offer, that she might treat with you?"_
* _"That (naming some proffered item) is a thing of beauty. Perhaps if you gave it into our safekeeping, to vouchsafe your good conduct, we might escort you to Lady Tyriana's courts, there to answer for yourselves and your presence here."_
* _"It is a terrible thing to incur our Lady's displeasure. Yet, in exchange for that (naming an item), I might venture to allow you to go whither you will and follow with my war-herd at some distance. Thus might I say truthfully that we were tracking your party, for it is perilous to deceive she who is Mistress of Lies."_
* _"I see that you are determined. We own that we have not the strength to hinder you. Yet, pity us! Make with us here us some show of combat so that we may say that you worsted us and we were forced to flee. Thus may we discharge our duty in the eyes of our Mistress and our lives may be spared."_

Shadow unicorns are treacherous to the core and Vikra will use all her cunning to get the party to stay in the area. If the adventurers agree to an escort, the unicorns will lead them in a circle back to their starting-point, where an ambush awaits them. If the party agrees to let the unicorns follow them, Vikra will send another messenger to direct the reinforcements to the party's most likely path and follow close behind from the Ethereal Plane so as to be ready to join in once the ambush starts. If the party agrees to the staged fight, the unicorns will drag it out by proposing a mock ambush, followed by a series of hit-and-run attacks, ostensibly for the sake of verisimilitude. Whatever their strategy, Vikra and her herd are far more in fear of their mistress than of a clean death at the hands of the adventurers. They will attack as soon as they believe that they have their best chance to prevail.

### The Reinforcements

During the fight between the adventurers and the blights, Vikra sized up the strength of the party and sent one of her herd to fetch reinforcements from the caves of a nearby colony of **cyclopes** who owe allegiance to Gothrog. This took some time to accomplish, since cyclops live some distance from each other, but the messenger will return with five cyclops herders the next morning. The party's actions in the previous encounter will determine the circumstances of the reinforcements' attack.

Due to their chaotic nature and limited cognition, the cyclops are considerably less duty-bound than the shadow unicorns. They have been promised an easy fight and good loot and they will be inclined to flee if the fact that they are losing makes it through their thick skulls. Vikra will only press the fight after this if it seems that the shadow unicorns have a fair shot at winning. Otherwise, she and her herd will escape to the Ethereal, some to keep an eye on the party and others to gallop ahead to warn Tyriana.

### The Haunted Bog

Tyriana's fortress is surrounded by a vast bog that was the site of a long-ago battle between the dark fey and an invading army of elves. It is now an abode of restless undead -- ghosts, vampire spawn, wraiths and will-o-wisps. The pall of Cymmyrion blocks out the sun so these creatures can be abroad even during the day. Travel through the bog is thus slow and perilous. Overland travel proceeds at one-quarter of the normal pace. Use the following random encounter table while the party is in the bog. Roll 1d20 every four hours, 1-5 = encounter.

| d20 Roll | Encounter |
| -------- | --------- |
| 1        | Sewer plague. |
| 2-6      | 3d6 animated plants (roll d6: 1-3 = awakened shrubs, 4-5 = awakened trees, 6 = shambling mounds) |
| 7-11     | 3d6 blights (roll d6: 1-2 = needle blights, 3-4 = twig blights, 5-6 = vine blights) |
| 12-13    | Native undead (roll d6: 1-2 = 2d4 ghosts, 3-4 = 2d4 ghouls/ghasts, 5-6 = 2d4 spectres) with 1d4 will-o-wisps |
| 14-15    | 2d4 vampire spawn |
| 16       | 1d6 wraiths |
| 17-18    | MoAET: 2-3B Temperate Creature Nighttime Marsh |
| 19       | ettin with 2d4 trolls |
| 20       | Exceptional (roll d6: 1-4 = wyvern, 5-6 = young black dragon) |

Randomly-encountered creatures will almost always be hostile to the characters and most will attack on sight.

## Episode 2

_In the distance, you see a ring of steep rock cliffs at least a mile across and several hundred feet high protruding from the badlands and bog. From the center of the ring a spire of black stone rises several hundred feet above the jagged cliff-tops. A vortex of wispy vapors and bluish purple witch-lights twists violently around the spire and rises up into swirling clouds that hover overhead. As you approach, you see that a tall, square gatetower juts from the base of one of the cliff-faces. You watch as a large, winged creature with a serpentine body rises from the battlements of the tower and speeds away to your left. An eerie howling that rises and falls in pitch and volume seems to originate from the vortex._

The spire floats on a base of black basalt at the center of a crater blasted deep into the ground long ago when injudicious use of powerful magic opened a channel between Cymmyrion and the sphere of Shadow. The vortex of mingled necrotic and fey energies that formed in the rift between worlds is too violent to allow for safe passage, but it features a placid eye in which even creatures of the mortal world can survive. For many centuries, Dharovin sorcerers exploited the eye of the vortex to enhance their dark rituals of communion with the Lords of Shadow. After his rise to the rulership of Cymmyrion, Gothrog the Tyrant raised a spire on the site to harness the powers of the vortex and the field of ambient necrotic energy it generates. He named this stronghold Blackfane Spire and granted it to be the fiefdom of his lieutenant Tyriana, an elven vampiress uniquely suited to its stewardship.

### General Features

#### The Cliffs

_As you approach closer, you can see that the cliffs are too steep and their planes and angles are too bizarre to be climbable. What is more, the lower faces of the cliffs are riddled with openings like maggot-holes. Some are the size of goblin-tunnels, while others are large enough for a dragon to crawl into. Noxious-looking fumes or seepage issues from some of the holes, while others have ramps or stairways of wood or stone leading to them._

The cliffs at the rim of the crater are very steep and the dark gray rock of which they are formed is hard and sharp-edged. They are essentially impassible, except by expert technical climbers and even then at considerable peril. The inner cliff-faces are even steeper and descend into a crater like a vertical tunnel several thousand feet deep.

#### The Spire

At the center of the inner Ring, a column of black basalt floats 100 feet above the floor of the crater and rises to within a hundred feet of ground level, where it forms the foundation for Blackfane Spire. Only a narrow ledge marks where the base of the spire meets the column.

The spire itself is shaped like a many-pointed star in cross-section. It is 200 feet wide for its first 800 feet of height. Above this, it tapers to a needle-sharp pinnacle over 1,600 feet above its base. The wall are built of huge blocks of glistening black stone, strangely fluted, joined without mortar, and fitted so precisely that it is difficult to slip even the edge of a knife between the stones. The lower half of the wall is featureless except for an archway that abuts a bridge that extends through the maelstrom to a tunnel that pierces the cliff on the inner Ring. Further details are obscured by the swirling mists of the vortex.

Inside the spire, the chambers and halls are formed of smaller blocks of the same black stone, laid with skilled precision by duergar stonemasons assisted by magic. The spaces between the inner and outer walls were filled with rubble of volcanic stone, magically fused so as to support the structure. In this way, the dark dwarves were able to build the spire much higher than would be practical by normal means. For the most part, the floors of the inner chambers are tiled in polished slabs of the black stone. The interiors of many of the chambers are clad in granite or marble and the ceilings are supported by columns and arches of the same material. At Tyriana’s insistence, the duergar imitated elven architecture and decoration, although their touch could not wholly be disguised.

#### The Vortex

Creatures that attempt to fly through the vortex will be swept up at a rate of 100 feet per round into black clouds four thousand feet up. When a creature starts its turn in the vortex, it takes 7 (1d8 +3) damage of a random type (d3: 1 = force, 2 = lightning, 3 = necrotic). Creatures that attempt to cross by means of dimension door, phase shift, teleportation, or similar magic will be thwarted by the fact that the vortex cuts across planes of existence. For this reason, divination spells such as scry or other spells such as dream that require the target to be on the same plane of existance as the caster will not work from outside the vortex to inside or vice-versa.

The ambient necrotic energy generated by the vortex mitigates the effects of radiant energy anywhere in the inside of Blackfane Ring or in the Spire itself. Vulnerability to radiant damage is negated and regeneration that would otherwise be prevented by radiant damage will function normally. The range of magical sources of illumination, such as a light spell, is halved.

#### The Gates

Tyriana has more to fear from spies and assassins than from armies. In typical fey fashion, she protects her stronghold as much with deception as with armed might. However, she also indulges her cruelty and macabre fascinations, sometimes at the expense of security or practicality. As a result, the Gates of Blackfane Ring are equal parts defense and theater.

Anywhere in Aelvalon, distance, direction, and even time tend to be misleading. Moreover, the Gates of Blackfane Ring are under an enchantment of misdirection. If the party takes the time to circle all the way around the ring of cliffs, they will count four great gates. Actually, there are only three. Every time the adventurers attempt to travel to a gate, it will take 1d3 hours to do so and you should determine the gate they actually arrive at by a roll of 1d3. This enchantment will mislead even find the path or similar magic unless it is backed by a wish or other powerful magic.

### Encounters

For each hour the party travels, roll 1d20 for a random encounter: 1-5 = encounter.

| d20 Roll | Encounter |
| -------- | --------- |
| 1-3      | 3d8 blights (roll d6: 1-2 = needle blights, 3-4 = twig blights, 5-6 = vine blights) |
| 4-6      | 3d8 swarms (roll d6: 1-4 = bats, 5-6 = rats) |
| 7-11     | Undead patrol (roll d6: 1-4 = 2d8 ghouls with 1d6 ghasts, 5-6 = 2d6 wights) |
| 12-14    | Aerial patrol (roll d6: 1-3 = 2d6 gargoyles, 4-5 = 2d6 spined devils, 6 = 1d4 peryton) |
| 14-15    | Cavalry patrol (roll d6: 1-3 = 2d6 hell hounds, 4-6 = 2d6 night centaurs) |
| 16-17    | 2d6 vampire spawn (roll d6: 1-4 = unmounted, 5-6 = mounted on nightmares) |
| 18       | 2d4 wraiths (roll d6: 1-4 = unmounted, 5-6 = mounted on wyverns) |
| 19       | MoaET: 2-3B Temperate Creature Nightime Marsh |
| 20       | Exceptional (roll d6: 1-3 = 1d4 shadow unicorns, 4-6 = 1d6 fomorians) |

With few exceptions, randomly-encountered creatures will be immediately hostile, since they can detect that the adventurers are living creatures. Undead monsters hate that.
