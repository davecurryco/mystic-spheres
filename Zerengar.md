# Zerengar

## Layout

Zerengar is surrounded by a palisade of timber atop stone foundations with stone buttresses, watchtowers and gatehouses. The town stands on more or less level ground at the base of _Karad-Zheran_ mountain, beside lake _Mar-Shalenin_ a gap overlooking the _Ger-Hezron_ valley to the south. The palisade abuts a steep mountainside to the north and the Keep is built into a cliff that rises in the eastern quarter of the town. The main gate is in the northeast section of the palisade. It opens almost directly on the town square and market, which stand beneath the gates of the Keep. There is a smaller gate in the southwest section of the palisade, which originally served a military purpose, but has come to be the route by which residents of the town and surrounding villages come and go on matters that do not concern the marketplace.

## Population and Governance

The acknowledged Master of Zerengar is Galron Goldhelm, the Thain of the _Zerenzher_ clan. Zerengar’s centerpiece is the Hall, actually a fort built into the mountainside where Galron keeps both his residence and his seat of government.

The population of the clans in Zerengar and its surrounds is approximately 8,000 dwarves. Some 4,000 of these are able-bodied males able to bear arms, a high proportion enabled by the long life-expectancy and preponderance of males in the dwarven population.

## Economy

Zerengar, with its surrounding network of villages and farms, is almost completely self-sufficient. The marketplace meets twice a week in the afternoon of the first and fourth days of the week in the late spring, all summer and early autumn. It mostly consists of local farmers selling and bartering agricultural products and livestock from their holdings in the valley countryside. However, there are also craftsmen and artisans who sell their services and wares from brightly-decorated carts.

A number of tradesmen have dwellings that border on the marketplace. These typically have shops on the first floor and residence quarters in the back or on a second floor. The tradesmen cover the usual essential services -- bakers, butchers, leatherworkers, metalsmiths, and carpenters. A mountain spring flows from the cliff into the town square. It not only provides the residents with fresh water, but also powers a flour mill. There are also two blacksmith/farriers, who have forges nearby. Except for the mill, these businesses are open year-round.

The Thain employs several specialist craftsmen, such as armorers. Two of these double as free-lance locksmiths. The Thain also employs a Guard -- twenty-four soldiers recruited from his clansmen under a Marshall, Branlor son of Hurnin, who is Galron’s brother-in-law. These professionals oversee the Watch and the Militia, both made up of clansmen who serve rotating watch duty year-around and a 65-day tour of duty after spring planting. The Guard also serves as Galron’s personal guard. A full-scale Muster can raise 1,750 troops in under a week and another 750 given an additional week. Galron has the power to decree a 30-day Emergency Muster at any time of year.

Mines and smelting operations in the surrounding area operate under license from the Thain, who takes a share of the profits. A commodities exchange, the Orlanmed, meets once a week in the Hall and this too operates under license from the Thain. For his part, the Thain provides safekeeping and transport security drawn from the Guard and Watch. He also employs a Master Assayer, Ashken son of Solor, who is responsible to certify the purity and weight of all metals bought and sold on the exchange.

## History

Because of the ever-present common threat from the goblins, the dwarven clans of the Southern Kindred have generally maintained friendly, if not cordial relations with each other. Some of the larger clans have even absorbed smaller clans and reconquered territory from the goblins. These clans have carved out a place for themselves which, if it does not approach the prosperity of their fathers’ times, offers a measure of security and hope for better times.

The most powerful of the dwarven clans of southern Kulzigal is the _Zerenzher_ (Mountain Bear) clan, whose Thain, Galron Goldhelm, ascended to headship by dint of his leadership in the diaspora. Galron led a group of his relatives from Sheurazak across the wilderness through many dangers and found refuge among their kindred in a small mining town overlooking the Ger-Hezron valley. Galron’s followers came to outnumber the original inhabitants and after a decisive victory over the local goblin tribe and the re-opening of veins of gold and silver in the mines, Galron was acclaimed chief of the clan. Since then, Galron has expanded Zerenzher power and influence, ridding the valley of goblins and improving the clan seat from a humble village into a large town on the verge of becoming a small city, _Zerengar_ (Bear’s Lair).
