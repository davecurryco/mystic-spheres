# Jeosong

Jeosong was once a city-state of Pashan called Khadizar. When Khadizar resisted Azruun conquest, the city was razed and its Alhrain population slaughtered. Because of its importance as a seaport, the victorious Azruun occupied the city, rebuilt it with slave labor recruited from the survivors of the siege, and gave it over to their Juchin allies, who renamed it Jeosong. The conquerors were unaware that Khadizar itself had been built atop the ruins of Ekazaar, one of the main city-states of the Old Kingdom famous for its many temples, labyrinths, and sorcerers. As a result, extensive subterranean ruins underlay Jeosong.

## Government and Politics

**Form of Government:** Bureaucracy

The _Mughad_ governor of Jeosong is particularly ineffective and his _Wajeer_ spend their energies in territorial feuds among themselves rather than in the administration of their ministries for the benefit of the city. This situation has bred corruption and strife, which has worked its way down to all levels of society in Jeosong. 

## Religion

**Majority Religion:** Polytheism

Most of the gods and goddesses worshipped in southwest Arestor have had shrines and temples dedicated to them in Jeosong or its predecessors. In Jeosong alone is Molor, the God of Strife, openly worshipped alongside more benign dieties such as Yshma and Kublai. Even the alien god Dakkar is worshipped in secret in ancient sea-cavern complexes beneath the city.

## Layout

The Old City of Jeosong, which contains the city's temples, tombs, and citadel, is built into a cliff that overlooks Tandong Bay. The harbor district lies below the city and a residential and trade district has expanded at the top of the cliff.
