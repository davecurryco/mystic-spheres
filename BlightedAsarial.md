## Lay of Lianniel

One day, as the party's bard strums his lute seeking inspiration, the instrument seems to go strangely out of tune. As he tries to bring its strings back to pitch, the bard strikes unusual, but somehow pleasing chords. As he experiments with the new tuning, a haunting melody emerges. It bears kinship only with some of the most ancient of the songs of the halfling-folk, Beneath the Rowan Tree and The Star Maiden's Lament, which are nowadays sung only by the oldest grandmothers of the Roamers and are never accompanied by instruments.

As his fingers play the ever more complex melody, words of a song spring unbidden to the bard's tongue, although not in any language he understands. They are four stanzas and the chorus of a ballad in Elvish called The Lay of Lianniel. Translated into Common, the words might be rendered: 

_Bright lay the dew on the greensward_  
_On the downs of Laesfaereon_  
_Jewels trodden by her bare white feet_  
_As she came to Caerlaesson_  
  
_A child was she, a maiden pure_  
_As the drops of crystal dew_  
_Yet, as in each a rainbow dwells_  
_In infinity of hue_  
  
_So in her sapphire eyes there shone_  
_As in a brightly mirrored hall_  
_Reflections of her countless lives_  
_And Ancient wisdom hers withal_  
  
_As though a slender willow wand_  
_Should turn the longsword's blade_  
_To foil the wizard tyrant cruel_  
_Forth to challenge came a maid_  

_Chorus:_

_Lianniel, Lianniel_  
_We still remember thee who dwell_  
_Beneath the shadow of thy doom_  
_And grieve for thine untimely tomb_
