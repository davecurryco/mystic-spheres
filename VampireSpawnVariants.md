**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 40 ft. (naiad)

**Innate Spellcasting.** The vampire spawn fey's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (Cha 18, +4) (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The vampire spawn fey can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _thorn whip_  
3/day each: _entangle, fog cloud_  
1/day each: _hold person, locate animals or plants, spike growth_  

**Magic Resistance.** The vampire spawn fey has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Speak with Beasts and Plants.** The vampire spawn fey can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.

A vampire spawn fey has the following additional action options:

**Fair Seeming.** The vampire spawn fey covers herself with a magical illusion that conceals the telltale signs of her undead nature. The illusion ends if the vampire spawn fey takes a bonus action to end it, if she attacks, or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the vampire fey spawn could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the vampire fey spawn is disguised.

**Fey Charm.** The vampire spawn fey targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the vampire spawn fey, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the vampire spawn fey as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire spawn fey's control, it takes the vampire’s requests of actions in the most favorable way it can.
Each time the vampire spawn fey or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire spawn fey dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If the target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the vampire spawn fey’s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.
The vampire spawn fey can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.

Depending on her background, a vampire fey has one of the following action options:

**Tree Stride (dryad).** Once on her turn, the vampire dryad can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically into one dead tree within her reach and emerge from a second dead tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.

**Drowning Embrace (naiad).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 13 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The attack automatically hits a creature charmed by the vampire naiad. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and pulled 5 feet toward the vampire naiad. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the vampire naiad tries to drown it, and the naiad can’t embrace another target.

**Enslaving Kiss (nymph).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one humanoid. The attack automatically hits a creature charmed by the vampire nymph. Hit: The target must succeed on a Wisdom DC 15 saving throw or be magically enslaved for 1 day. The enslaved target obeys the vampire nymph's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from the vampire nymph or receives a suicidal command, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the vampire nymph’s Fey Charm and Enslaving Kiss for the next 24 hours. If the target is still under the effect of the Enslaving kiss at the end of the encounter, the vampire nymph can sustain the effect indefinitely by kissing the target once per day. The vampire nymph can affect only one target at a time with its enslaving kiss.
