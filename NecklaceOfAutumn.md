# The Necklace of Autumn

_Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)_

This necklace is crafted of gold fashioned in the shape of autumn leaves set with ruby and tourmaline in all the colors of fall. The _Necklace of Autumn_ is an heirloom of the Elesanni and is imbued with fey powers to marshal the forces of autumn weather to protect the wearer.

You must be attuned to the necklace and wearing it as a neck slot item to use its properties.
