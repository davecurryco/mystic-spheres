# History of the Old Kingdom

## Legendary Times

### The Deeds of Erelech

This Old Kingdom text is a written record drawn from a much earlier oral tradition. The saga recounts the career of a hero who stole magic from the Gods, used it to free his people and suffered a terrible retribution. This tale gives a loose account of the actual events of human emancipation from the Aelvii and the subsequent conflict with the Goblins. The saga composes the deeds of several early human leaders into a single epic tale, with a great deal of confounded fact and outright embellishment thrown in. However, with context from the Dwarven or Elven historical record it would be possible to glean the essentials of ancient human history from this saga.

## Historical Times

Actual human historical records begin with _The History of the Great Kingdom_, written in the reign of Selen II, fifth ruler of the Sarod dynasty of Belasher, a kingdom that comprised most of the pre-diluvian territory of present Khanashar, Ophar, and Hannesh. This text recounts the foundation of the Sarod dynasty by the warrior-priest Hashrar and the rise of Belasher to become the foundation of what is currently known as the Old Kingdom.

From this point, Old Kingdom history is documented, with some significant gaps, in various surviving texts through the reign of Pelashad IV, fourth ruler of the Armas dynasty. To protect the northern extent of his territories, Pelashad's great-great grandfather, Nereanor I, began construction of the Shield Wall. The construction was essentially complete by Pelashad IV's reign. By this time, however, the Old Kingdom had become effete and finally succumbed to invasion from a completely different quarter, the Azruun.
