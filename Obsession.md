# Obsession

_8th-level enchantment_

**Casting time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 30 days  

You magically produce an overwhelming obsession in a creature that you can see within range, compelling it to carry out some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. If the course of action is contrary to the creature's nature or alignment, it has advantage on the saving throw. While the creature is charmed by you, it is wholly preoccupied with the course of action you have set and pursues it to the best of its ability. A charmed creature regards you as a trusted mentor to be heeded in the matter. The _obsession_ may even cause the creature to regard its former allies as adversaries if they seek to dissuade or thwart it in carrying out the course of action. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can set any action or activity you choose, short of one that would result in certain death. Should you urge a suicidal action, the spell ends.

You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A _remove curse_, _greater restoration_, or _wish_ spell also ends it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the duration is 1 year and a day.
