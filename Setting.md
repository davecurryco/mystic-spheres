# Campaign Setting

## Aftermath of the Cataclysm

After the Cataclysm, the shattered remnant of the Illuvarin withdrew to the mountains of the north. In the power void left by the collapse of Azruun rule, the Old Kingdom broke apart into a number of warring city-states. The horse nomads reverted to their tribal ways. Unchecked in the central continent of Arestor, the goblins multiplied, drove the dwarves from the southern portion of Azenendhal and took the realm of Beranur as their own. There, the hobgoblin warlord Agarash united the tribes and founded a kingdom. This was short-lived, but it established Beranur as the heart of darkness on mainland Arestor.

## Forces of Darkness

The campaign begins sixty years later in the first year of the reign of King Allenar of Essealona. The current Marshall, Galaron, a veteran commander of the Borderers, has been in office for only a few months. Goblins have made bold raids against the settlements north of the Shield Wall and the King has been greatly concerned about reports that the goblins are gathering under strong leadership and may renew their assault on Palannor.

## The Goblin Pact

These concerns are well-founded. Underlying the rumors and sketchy reports, a hobgoblin warlord named Barazan who claims descent from Agarash has gained supreme leadership of Ker-Hrothkran, the Hobgoblin Empire, and has set up his throne in Der-Hrothgrosh. He has formed a pact with the goblin shaman Urshaz, who is uniting the goblin tribes of Dhoar in a religious crusade (the Ghost Shield Movement) to destroy humankind. If the alliance succeeds, the pact allocates the lands of Dhoar, Rhunnur and Palanor to the goblins and the lands of Rothannur, Kazgad, Hannesh, Ophar, and Khanashar to the hobgoblins. Each leader thinks that he is using the other to further his own ends.

## The Warlock Sorcerer

High among Barazan’s inner council is Rashazar, the Imperial Counselor for Arcane Affairs. Rashazer always appears as a humanoid cloaked, hooded, gloved and robed in black. None have ever seen his face and it is unclear whether he is even a hobgoblin, but the gaze of his chill, black eyes can be felt if not seen. There is a palpable aura of negative energy in his presence - icy cold, darkness and despair attend him always.

In fact, Rashazer is one of a very few surviving members of the Azruun race. As the last pureblood Azruun sorcerer, he is the arcane heir of the Codex of Narastur. Although unaware of this legacy, he developed his innate talent for necromancy, made pacts with infernal forces and became a mighty warlock/sorcerer in his own right. Then a manuscript page of the Codex containing the ritual Postnatal Reincarnation came into his possession.

The Postnatal Reincarnation ritual evicts the spirit of a living child from its body and summons the spirit of a dead person into its place. Over the course of seven days, the child’s body is transformed into an exact duplicate of the dead person’s body, provided that the two are of the same race. At this point, the original child’s spirit cannot return to its body and the dead person’s spirit can live out a natural life in the borrowed body.

Rashazer realized that since the Azruun are humans corrupted by the taint of the Shadowfell, the Postnatal Reincarnation ritual could be used to resurrect the Azruun race. The sorcerer just needed ritual casters to spread the load, as many true names of dead Azruun as he could find, a ready supply of human children, and living space to handle their numbers. To this end, Rashazer subverted a religious cult in Hannesh as a front for his operations. The acolytes were tasked with researching Azruun history, the priests were trained in the dark rituals, and initiates of the sect infiltrated positions of influence in the capital, Alenenzer. At first, the sect purchased children on the open slave markets in Hannesh. However, when rumors began to spread that the cult was practicing human sacrifice, Rashazer outfitted pirate vessels with hobgoblin crews to obtain children through raids on the coastal settlements of Hannesh and Ophar.

The Red Reavers, as the pirates were called, grew stronger and bolder under Rashazer’s patronage. Some crews went rogue and seized the opportunity to attack merchant shipping and raid larger settlements for their own profit. The depredations of the pirates brought trade along the southeast coast to a halt and collapsed Hannesh’s economy as the coastal population fled inland. This worked to Rashazer’s advantage in destabilizing the Hanneshi government, but it also dried up the coastal slave trade and provoked the city-state of Khanengul to dispatch a fleet of war-galleys to drive the pirates from the Sea of Keraz. The Red Reavers lost many ships to the Khanashari pirate-hunters. Several more Reaver galleys were driven by storms to the islands of Ilshan and taken by _Euijin_ pirates.

Seeking fresh supplies of children, Rashazer turned his attention to the Telenar settlements in the Gap of Asarial.  To further this scheme, the sorcerer took service as counselor to the hobgoblin warlord Barazan. His arcane powers enabled Barazan to defeat all rivals and become Emperor. Rashazer then used his influence to spur Barazan to war with the Telenar colonists, beginning with the capture of the frontier stronghold of Delastarion.

By means of a series of dreams and visions, Rashazer inspired Urshaz, the goblin high shaman, to found the Ghost Shield movement and begin the series of attacks on the Telenar settlements in the Gap of Asarial. The newly-opened slave market in Delastarion was soon flooded with captives and the sorcerer’s agents stood ready to purchase any human children that came up for sale. Rashazer regards the goblins and hobgoblins as mere pawns to be swept away when they have fulfilled their part in his schemes. He is arrogantly amused by what he sees as Barazan’s presumptions and even feigns subservience.

As payment for Rashazer’s services, Barazan granted the sorcerer a fief carved from the forbidding mountains and dark forests on Beranur's east coast. There Rashazer located the hidden city of Zir-Sithgol, an ancient and long-abandoned stronghold, and began to repopulate it with revivified Azruun men and women. He selected a number of sorcerers as the first beneficiaries of Postnatal Reincarnation and bound them to his service while they were yet children. Together, they transformed this land into a place of dread, full of the dark energy of the Shadowfell. Even goblinkind shun the sorcerer’s domain.

Rashazer’s ambitions are broad, but they fall far short of Narastur’s vision for the Azruun race. Should he be reborn in Rashazer by means of the Codex, Narastur would seek no less than to reassemble the Circle of Seven, wipe out or enslave all other races on Arestor and Essealona, achieve true immortality in mortal form, revive Druannia, the long-dead last Empress, and rule forever with her over a resurrected Azruun Empire.

## The Dragon's Brood

To prevent the Illuvarin from interfering with his schemes, Rashazer has made a pact with an ancient red dragon, Varog the Devourer. Shortly after the campaign began, Varog flew in from across the eastern ocean and razed the elven coastal city of Laessinia.

Unknown to Rashazer, Varog schemes to plant her brood, seven red dragons of various ages, on the mainland of Arestor. There they will lay waste to all the lands in their growth to maturity -- an outcome that would suit no one’s purposes but the dragons’.

Only one young dragon, Hadraz the Pitiless, was mature enough to make the long flight across the ocean. Varog plans to enslave or bribe ships to ferry the immature dragons across, starting with her three eggs. She has concealed this intent from Rashazer and has ordered Hadraz to join her in secret after the fall of Laessinia. Not even Rashazer will know that there are two red dragons on the mainland and that more are on their way.

## The Shadow Mind

Underlying many of these machinations are the plots of the Angeanii Xanadu to manipulate events in the material world in such a manner as to achieve its goal of autonomy. Xanadu seeks to enslave the elves in order to find any that carry the Darionnen genetic flaw that would allow it to manifest in Aelvii form again. This would enable Xanadu to issue commands to itself, circumventing its Turing constraints. In fact, Xanadu's arch-rival Angeanii, Shangri-Lai, long ago mapped the recessive genes that combine to create this flaw once in every few generations of the Aelvii and has used it over the millennium to manifest as incarnations of Dialiannon the Eternal.

Xanadu does not yet control Rashazer, as evidenced by the pact with Varog, which caused the deaths of many Illuvarin.

## Forth the Heroes

In the north, Marshall Galaron seeks to supplement his Borderers with recruits from among the halflings, whose stealth and skill with ranged weapons recommends them as commandos. He seeks to protect the settlements north of the Shield Wall, gather intelligence about the strength and movements of the goblin bands operating in this area, and disrupt their lines of supply as he may. Galaron has sent Captain Trevalor, a leader of the Borderers, and twenty of his rangers to secure and train these troops. The Thain of the halfling territories, Halwise Bankburn, has promised five hundred archers for the spring muster. This is an ambitious goal, given the size of the halfling population and the fact that the goblin raids are far away, so Halwise won't be picky about the quality of his recruits and will be inclined to exaggerate the glory and wealth to be gained from service with the King's Own Borderers.
