## Actions

**Constrict.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the bloodleech vine can’t constrict another target.

**Tendril.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the bloodleech vine, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 2 (1d4) piercing damage.  
When a tendril attack hits a creature, the tendril remains attached until the bloodleech vine is reduced to 0 hit points, is incapacitated, or detaches the tendril as an action. A vine can attach up to 6 tendrils in this way and the DC to escape the vine’s grapple increases by 1 for each tendril attached.

**Life Drain.** At the start of each of the vine’s turns, a creature that the blood leech vine has attached one or more tendrils to takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for each attached tendril. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by the amount of necrotic damage taken, and the bloodleech vine regains hit points equal to that amount. If an attached tendril is forcibly removed, as when a creature escapes the vine’s grapple, the target takes 4 (1d4 +2) piercing damage and must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned by the searing pain until the end of the target’s next turn. A creature killed in this way has its soul destroyed.

Also called a **Pottsylvania Creeper**, a **Bloodleech Vine** drains life-force from its victims along with their blood. A bloodleech vine will typically attach multiple tendrils to its target so as to reduce it to 0 hit points quickly. After the target loses consciousness, the vine will detach all but one tendril and will thereafter only cause necrotic damage as the target regains hit points. The result is that the target is kept at the edge of consciousness as the bloodleech vine feeds. A target gains 1 level of exhaustion for each hour of this treatment.
