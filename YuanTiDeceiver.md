**Shapechanger.** The yuan-ti deciever can use its action to polymorph into a Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The yuan-ti's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). The yuan-ti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _animal friendship (snakes only)_ 
3/day: _suggestion_

**Magic Resistance.** The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Ambusher.** The doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.

**Surprise Attack.** If the yuan-ti deciever surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.

In its true form, a **Yuan-Ti Deceiver** looks like a Type 1 (human body with snake head) Yuan-Ti Malison. However, it isn't often that a deciever is seen in its true form, for these creatures take on the guise of humans around them to serve as spies, assassins, or agents on missions that would pose too great a risk of exposure to entrust to a pureblood.
