**Ruinous Presence.** At the start of each of the elven wight's turns, each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the aura of doom and downfall that surrounds it. Affected creatures are incapacitated until the end of the elven wight's next turn. A creature that has saved against the effect or on which the effect has worn off is immune to the effect for 24 hours.

**Fey Sight.** The elven wight can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

**Fey Ancestry.** Magic can't put the elven wight to sleep.

**Magic Weapon.** The elven wight’s weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wight makes three longsword attacks or three longbow attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

**Life Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a lesser wight under the elven wight’s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The elven wight can have no more than ten lesser wights under its control at one time.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage or 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage.

**Elven Wights** were powerful elves in life who are cursed to undeath, usually due to the pursuit of dark and forbidden arcane knowledge. Elven wights are weakened by sunlight, so they commonly retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, or tombs during the day.
