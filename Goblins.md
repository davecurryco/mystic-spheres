# Goblins

## Divisions of Goblinkind

Goblin-kind consist of four related, but distinct species: Bugbears, Goblins, and Hobgoblins.

It is difficult to say what the natural lifespan is for any species of goblin, since so very few of them die of natural causes. Hobgobins stand the best chance and among them, 45 years of age is considered venerable.

### Bugbears

Bugbears are a separate species of goblin-kind, but they have almost no culture or history of their own. Rather, they occupy a niche in the societies of goblins and hobgoblins. Originally bred to be berserker shock-troops, bugbears still fill this role in hobgoblin armies and gravitate to similar positions as enforcers and overseers in hobgoblin society. Among goblins, bugbears are often employed as champions or thugs. Occasionally, one or more bugbears will show enough initiative to seize headship of a tribe of goblins, but this arrangement invariably leads to ruin.

Bugbears are remarkably egalitarian when it comes to the sexes. Bugbear females are, on the average, almost as large and strong as the males. Childbearing only slows them down a little and except for a brief nursing period, female bugbears delegate child-rearing to goblin slaves. Bugbears respect only one thing -- power. Since females are able to compete on a more-or-less equal footing, they are accorded more-or-less equal status in what passes for society among bugbears. Indeed, outsiders often have difficulty telling male bugbears and female bugbears apart from one another.

### Goblins

Goblins are driven by an urge to dominate other creatures. They painstakingly domesticate animal and monster species and enthusiastically enslave members of any humanoid race. Goblin social structure is every bit as hierarchical as that of hobgoblins, but it is far less formal and far more fluid. The strong dominate the weak and each goblin constantly seeks to improve his standing in the pecking-order. Notwithstanding this competitiveness, goblins are intensely social creatures and cannot imagine doing anything alone. Goblins willingly follow a strong leader and even the strongest leader is, in a sense, always looking over his shoulder to make sure that the others are following.

Goblins are also intensely spiritual. They believe that their deceased ancestors constantly watch and judge their actions from the spirit world. To goblins, success and strength is a reward from the ancestors, while failure and sickness is a punishment. The weak deserve to be downtrodden and the strong have the mandate of the spirits to do the treading.

However, goblins are not animist. The natural world is there to be dominated as well. Goblins despoil their environment as thoroughly as their technological capabilities permit. Even Diggers must eventually move on once they have depleted the resources around their settlements.

Goblin males wear all the personal adornments they can carry. Diggers tend toward metal ornaments, while Enemies wear more readily-available materials such as bone, shells and feathers. Goblin warriors of both types sport tattoos, piercings and ritual scarification that mark acts of prowess and distinction.

Goblin females, by contrast, are treated as mere possessions and most are dispirited drabs. Some are born with arcane or divine talents and may be left alone at the fringes of society, respected and feared for their powers but shunned for the same reason.

#### Goblin Tribes

Goblins are divided into several main tribal groupings (or "peoples").

##### Ghazra

The culture of the _Gharzra_ (Enemies) resembles that of the pre-reservation Apache in that their highest level of social organization is an itenerant band of individuals loosely related by blood.

The Ghazra inhabit the wastelands of Dhoar. They scrape a bare existence from the land and from raids on nearby settlements.

##### Klerzra

The _Klerzra_ (Diggers) resemble the Navajo in that they settle in permanent dwellings and have somewhat larger bands. However, unlike the Apache and Navajo, whose matrilocal traditions brought a degree of stability, goblin bands of both types gather around the strongest warrior in the family. Females have almost no status as most are slaves taken in war or raids.

The Klerzra predominate in the hill-country and mountains of Rothannur and Rhunnur. They are the most adaptable of the goblin peoples. Some tribes make their living from hunting, herding or even agriculture. Others were taught the skills of mining as slaves to dwarves or hobgoblins and continued this livelihood after winning their freedom.

##### Ankra

The _Ankra_ (Runners) resemble Zulus in that they dwell in large settlements, often fortified, and have a more sophisticated social and military structure than the other goblin peoples. Their warriors live together in units called "lodges" from childhood and are trained to fight as a unit. Compared to other goblins, Ankra are tall and wiry -- most males are over 4 feet tall. Most of their warriors have Fast Runner as a feat.

Most Ankra inhabit the plains of Dhoar, where they herd cattle and wage incessant war on their neighbors and with each other. However, a number of Ankra tribes were isolated in the wooded hill-country north of the Gate of Asarial by the events of the Cataclysm.

### Hobgoblins

Hobgoblin civilization most resembles that of ancient Rome in the days of its decline and downfall.

Hobgoblin society is characterized by harsh martial discipline and rigid caste hierarchy. Males are reared as soldiers in military units from a young age and advance in rank through both ability and guile. Females are valued mainly for the production of male offspring, but high-ranking hobgoblin women occasionally obtain a measure of influence through their sons. At all levels, hobgoblins seek power and status and inevitably abuse whatever measure of either they attain. For this reason, hobgoblins are invariably governed by a despot, great or petty.

Male hobgoblins carefully cultivate machismo. They wear their hair clipped short and invariably wear close-cropped beards. They consider personal jewelry and even tattoos to be effeminate. They prize scars received in combat (the more visible and horrific the better), but they despise ritual scarification as fake. Hobgoblins men often drink and gamble when off-duty, but open drunkenness and cheating are counter to military discipline and are not tolerated. Theft, desertion and oath-breaking are punished by death. Duels of honor are common, but the parties must first obtain permission from their superiors.

The hobgoblin military is rigidly stratified according to their caste system. Officers must purchase their commissions, but share in the spoils of war according to a traditional system of division by ranked shares. Advancement by assassination is not uncommon, especially at the higher ranks.

Female hobgoblins are raised in the households of their fathers’ superior officers in the service of their wives. Once they are of childbearing age, young females are given to the officers’ subordinates as a reward for loyalty or valor, to his peers to foster alliances, or to his superior in the hope of currying favor. Officers also reallocate the wives of fallen subordinates. At any time, a male hobgoblin may send a wife who is barren or otherwise displeases him “down the chain”. For these reasons, high-ranking hobgoblin men generally have a harem of up to a dozen subservient females, while soldiers of the lowest ranks share a pool of degraded slatterns.

The upper class of women are highly cloistered and dress and act with extreme modesty when they are permitted to go out in public. However, in private, harem rivalries are conducted with equally extreme cruelty and vindictiveness. Slatterns of the lower ranks dress provocatively, wear their wealth in the form of bangles and piercing-rings, and sport intricate tattoos. Their behavior is boisterous and often lewd, but the viciousness of their rivalries is even more appalling.

## Goblin History

The intrinsic violence of goblin civilization has ensured periodic destruction of the oral traditions of the goblins and the records kept by hobgoblin rulers. For this reason, the goblinoid races have preserved far less history even than is known to humans.

## Goblin Language

All branches of goblinkind speak a common Goblin language. However, differences between the dialects spoken by different tribes, even of the same species, are often so profound that speakers of one dialect cannot understand speakers of another. For this reason, a trade dialect is used when members of different tribes interact in trade or warfare. This trade dialect is also used by other races, such as orcs, ogres, and trolls, in the same situations.
