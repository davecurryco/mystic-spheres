# Varog the Destroyer

## Description

To prevent the Illuvarin from interfering with his schemes, Rashazer has made a pact with an ancient red dragon, Varog the Destroyer. Shortly after the campaign began, Varog flew in from across the eastern ocean and razed the elven coastal city of Laessinia.

Unknown to Rashazer, Varog schemes to plant her brood, seven red dragons of various ages, on the mainland of Arestor. There they will lay waste to all the lands in their growth to maturity -- an outcome that would suit no one’s purposes but the dragon’s.

Only one young dragon, Hadraz the Pitiless, was mature enough to make the long flight across the ocean. Varog plans to enslave or bribe ships to ferry the immature dragons across, starting with her three eggs. She has concealed this intent from Rashazer and has ordered Hadraz to join her in secret after the fall of Laessinia. Not even Rashazer will know that there are two red dragons on the mainland and that more are on their way.
