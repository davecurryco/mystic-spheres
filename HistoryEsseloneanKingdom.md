# History of the Essealonan Kingdom

## Timeline

The Telenar number years according to the reigns of the kings of Essealona since its foundation. For example, Telenar scribes might record that a certain event happened _calaperia_ Aranor I, "in the reign of" Aranor I.

## Major Events

### Establishment of Essealona

Some fifteen-hundred years prior to the current time, the Telenar, refugees from a continent far to the west, arrived at the new island to the west of the continent of [Arestor](.md) and christened it [Essealona](.md). The smaller island to the south they named [Verunor](.md).

### The Reign of the Usurper

The rightful king of Essealona was named Nessaran at birth. He took the name Allenar III on his ascension to the throne on attaining adulthood, three years after the death of his father Allenar II. In the interval, the Royal Council of Essealona appointed Caladron son of Celesor, an ambitious noble, as regent.

Caladron used his time on the throne to form a secret alliance of noble families, powerful financiers, and wealthy merchants. The regent formed a royal society called [GuardiansOfTheSceptre](GuardiansOfTheSceptre.md) and appointed his co-conspirators to its chief posts. When, only a few months into the second year of his reign, Allenar disappeared during a hunting expedition, Caladron promptly reclaimed the title of regent. When the Council objected that they had not appointed him this second time, Caladron ordered the body disbanded and its members arrested. However, several of the Councilmen escaped capture. Aided by members of [FellowesOfTheWhiteQuill](FellowesOfTheWhiteQuill.md) and by loyalist nobles, the fugitives raised public opposition to Caladron's reign.

The usurper reacted with increasing brutality, culminating in a two-day reign of terror in the southwestern port city of Rhorne. The wanton bloodshed repulsed even Caladron's allies in the Order of the Guardians. Fearing that they could be next, the usurper's backers turned on him. In short order, Caladron the Despised, as he had come to be called, was dethroned and forced to flee into hiding.

King Allenar, however, still could not be found. The re-assembled Council appointed a new regent, Areglen son of Arlethor to reign until the king returns or can be legally presumed dead seven years and a day after the date of his disappearance. Reluctant to start what might become a civil war, Areglen accepted the renegade aristocrats' excuse that they had been misled and had backed Caladron only because they thought his resumption of the regency was legitimate. As a result, Areglen's grasp on power is insecure, as it leaves the conspirators of the Guardians in positions of power from which they may well strike again.
