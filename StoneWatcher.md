## Actions

**Forbiddance.** The watcher uses one of the following magical effects at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 60 feet of it:

  1) _Paralysis._ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
  2) _Fear._ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
  3) _Slowness._ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
  4) _Sleep._ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This effect has no effect on constructs and undead.

**Stone Watchers** are constructs similar to stone golems, but they cannot move and attack with magic rather than physically.
