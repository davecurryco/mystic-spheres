# The Downshires

Halflings name their homeland _The Downshires_.

## Geography

### Landscape

The physical geography of the Downshires is determined by a line of chalk downland hills that extend west from the southern Moonglow Mountains and are split by the Bainwithy Vale. The downs run northwest to southeast, with their scarp slope facing Kingsland Strait to the southwest. Two ridges extend from the hills toward the channel and the vale between them has good clay soil overlaying the parent chalk. The Downshires is bordered to the north by the Bainwithy River valley, which cuts deeply through the calcareous grasslands of the north downs. To the south, the downlands give way to the southern extent of the Moonglow Mountains and the Faldonnin River valley that marches down to the bay of Rhon-Forome.

The settled areas of the Downshire total 4,500 square miles, with another 2,500 square miles of seasonal pasturage in the north.

### Climate

The coastal climate of the Downshire is characteristically mild.

## Population and Governance

The total settled population of the Downshire is 225,000 Dweller halflings. Another 75,000 Roamers live as nomads.

### Administrative Districts

The Downshires are divided into three counties. The southernmost county, _Whitecliffe Downs_, has the most arable land and is the most populous. _Meadfarthing_, on the border of the Bainwithy Valley, is the largest, but it has few settlements. The hilly region between them is named _Middefold_.

Whitecliffe Downs and Middefold are populated by Dwellers. These counties are subdivided into shires, each of which is further divided into wards of one hundred hides, a term that refers to a landholding of 30-40 acres sufficient to support a family. Thainholt, the chief town of Whitecliffe Downs, has the largest population of any settlement in the Downlands — some 2,500 halflings. The second largest town, at 1,750 is Bourne, which is the county seat of Middefold and is the only halfling settlement ever to have been fortified. There are 18 other towns with populations of 500-1,000 for a total urban population of 17,750. The rest of the settled population dwells in smaller villages, hamlets, or isolated farms.

Meadfarthing is mainly used for seasonal grazing by the Roamer clans, whose elders meet each fall to apportion territories, _meadtakes_, for the following spring. A meadtake is equivalent to a ward, being an allotment of pasture land sufficient to support a clan of 60 to 120 families. There are over 200 clans formed into a dozen or so shifting alliances.

## Economy

Halflings are overwhelmingly agrarian, either as farmers in the case of Dwellers, or as nomadic herdsmen in the case of Roamers.
