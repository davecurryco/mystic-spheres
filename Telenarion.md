# Telanarion

The Great Hall of the Governor is located in Telenarion as are the headquarters of the Colonial Guard. Bolstered by its central location at the mouth of the Celadonnin River on the bay of Rhon-Eleanonn, Telenarion is also the main hub of trade and commerce for the Telenar colonies on Arestor.

Telenarion was founded by the original explorers and settlers who were sent by King Palancar I to recolonize Arestor, as the Telenar call the mainland east of Essealona. As a chartered colony of a mature civilization well advanced in architecture, engineering and military technology, the Telenar carefully chose the site and constructed the walled settlement according to a civic plan that allowed for its eventual growth. Thus, Telenarion is a functional, well-organized place even though it has grown into a fairly large city.

Bolstered by lucrative trades in raw materials, food and wine with its mother island, Telenarion is prosperous and bustling. It people are generally orderly, independent and hard-working, a legacy of their frontier origins. The kings of Essealona have generally afforded the settlers wide latitude to govern their own affairs and have universally been unsparing in their support of the military campaigns necessary to drive the goblins and their monstrous allies from the lands of Palanor and Rothannur.

Despite the general law-abiding character of the Telenar, the capital attracts its share of unsavory characters. Black-sheep scions of noble Essealonan families add a dark undercurrent to the city's social, political and religious circles. Greedy and ambitious landholders and merchants plot ascendency. A small, but ruthless criminal element seeks to advance their own schemes and is available for hire in the schemes of others. And in the back streets and alleys of the Foreign Quarter near the wharves of the West Harbor, the Governors have traditionally turned a blind eye to activities that would be tolerated nowhere else.

## Layout

Telenarion was originally built on the east bank of the Celadonnin River, but it expanded to the west bank soon thereafter. The Great Road runs east to west through the city and the wharves of Valia Harbor occupy much of the south side. The Nalaronn Bridge spans the river north of the harbor at the foot of Citadel Bluff. The Citadel of Ethelion, named for the first colonial Governor, stands as a commanding presence atop the bluff. The highest reaches of its keep, the Tower of Pelennir, can be seen from any part of the city.

The streets follow the line of the river on both sides. Civic Square lies at the juncture of the ways to the bridge, the harbor and the citadel. Lesser marketplaces are situated at key intersections and gates.

The city draws its water from a tributary of the Celadonnin river at a point well northeast of the city. It is carried by aqueduct to a distribution station inside the walls north of the East Gate. From there, it is piped to various points in the city - even crossing the river by means of conduits built into the Naralonn Bridge. The Citadel was designed to be self-sufficient and so has its own wells. Most buildings in the city are also equipped with cisterns to store rainwater drained from their roofs.

This layout encouraged the development of specialized districts in the city, a separation reinforced later by decrees of the Marshall. However, the degree to which the Telenar integrate religious practice with daily life may be seen in the lack of a dedicated temple district. Rather, small temples and shrines are scattered throughout the city, each located according to the convenience or preferences of its devotees.

## Districts

### The Citadel of Ethelion

The Citadel is the center of military and political power in Telenarion and, by extension, all of Palanor and Rothannur. .

#### Northgate Landing

This is a private dock for the use of the Marshall and the Guard of the Citadel. At its south end, a set of stairs winds steeply to the north gate of the Citadel.

#### Great Hall of the Governor

Inside the north gate, to the west of Northgate Square, the Great Hall of the Marshall rises. It is built of white stone from a quarry in the mountains of northern Rothannur and has a steep roof. It is surrounded by a wall of local grey stone.

Governor Nerestal holds council and official entertainments here.

#### Northgate Square

This is the main gathering-place of the Citadel. It is used for official ceremonies. At its south end is the King's Arch.

A monument to King Palancar I, built in the reign of his namesake Palancar II, the King's Arch is built of fine white granite on a base of black basalt. Beneath its arch, a statue of the first Palancar carved in marble stands facing north. The king is depicted as a middle-aged man in light armor looking toward the horizon, shading his eyes with his right hand and holding a sextant at his hip with his left.

The main gate of the Citadel is flanked by two strong gate towers. The base of the tower to the west is joined to the abutment of a stone wall that spans the river in the fashion of an arch bridge with open-spandrel construction. Its top rises twenty feet above the surface of the water. The spaces between the arches are wide enough to allow boats to pass beneath them, but they may be closed off to river traffic by means of iron portcullises that can be lowered down to the surface of the water.

#### Civic Square

The Square is the heart of the city's trade and civic life. The Square Market opens each day except First Day and is filled with merchants and traders buying and selling all kinds of good. In the afternoon of First Day, the Square is open for assemblies of citizens to discuss the affairs of the city and the colonies. Once a month, the Governor's Assembly is held so that citizens can voice their concerns, suggestions and appeals directly to the Governor and his officials.

#### Inns and Taverns

_Sudden Squall Tavern_

**Proprieter:** Rengar son of Hanloron.

A one-story tavern favored by sailors of the coastal vessels.

Rengar is a former shipmaster who has sailed to Rhorne in Essealona and as far south as Khanengul in Khanashar. He is an old man, but his mind is keen and insightful. He is connected to such networks of smugglers and organized crime as exist in Telenarion and he plays these connections to his own advantage, although he avoids direct involvement in criminal activities.

#### Tower of Erhedron

This tall, flat-roofed tower was constructed as a strong-point of the harbor defenses, a place from which riders of the Skywatch could command the mouth of the river.

Because hippogriffs cannot be permanently stationed in the city, the tower is generally unoccupied except by watchmen who look over the harbor and river.

#### Inns and Taverns

_Garden of Asheran Inn_

This two-story inn, with its thick walls, arched windows and inner courtyard typical of South Kingdoms architecture, stands out amid the surrounding buildings.

_Cat and Kettle Inn_

**Proprieter:** Bandro Heathgarden.

This building is new and is built of local materials in a style not much different than that of its neighbors. However, its low-roofed, single-story construction and round windows and doors mark it as an establishment catering to halflings.

### Bridge Gate District

#### Bridge Gate Row

Because of its unique location, this section of the Bridge Gate district is home to a variety of businesses that deal in out-of-the-ordinary goods and services.

#### Shops

_Ardoras the Bookseller_

**Proprieter:** Ardoras son of Paladras.

A three-story building with a shop on the first and second floors and living quarters on the third. The first floor of the shop trades in books, scrolls and maps of the ordinary variety, while rare (and sometimes arcane) volumes can be found on the second.

Ardoras is a cheerful, inoffensive young man who inherited the business from his father, a minor wizard who died of old age a few years ago. Although Ardoras was not cut out to be a magic user, he is an avid scholar. He reads and speaks the language of the Southern Kindoms and can read Arcanic and several archaic languages such as Old Kingdom and Azruun.

Ardoras has many connections to the wizards of the city and the ships, some through his father and others on his own account. He is well liked and owed many favors, even by those wizards who tend toward darkness. Anyone who harms him will surely be brought to account in supernatural ways.

_Venulon's Esoterica_

**Proprieter:** Venulon son of Venulor.

A two-story building with a four-story tower adjoining its left end. This shop trades in rare materials for spell and ritual components.

Venulon is a brooding, fat man with long, curling black hair and a close-cropped beard, both streaked with gray. He is a wizard of no mean skill, but he is materialistic and has found trade in arcane items to be highly profitable. He has many connections and routinely brokers the purchase and sale of common magic items, excluding weapons other than daggers and staffs. He can also generally find a buyer for uncommon magic items and can sometimes even find someone willing to sell a particular uncommon item.

| Type | Sell (d20) | Buy (d20) | Days | Commission |
| ---- | ---------- | --------- | ---- | ---------- |
| Common | 5-20 | 11-20 | 1d4 | 5% |
| Uncommon | 10-20 | 19-20 | 2d8 | 10% |

Venulon's wealth has purchased favors and protection from both legitimate and illicit powers in the city. He has defenses of his own as well.

#### Bridge Gate Barracks

These are the headquarters of the city watch. The barracks also serves as a depot for the Colonial Post.

#### Towers of Nerestar

The two towers that flank the west gate to the Celedonnin Bridge are built of black basalt quarried from the valley of the Talonnin river. They are several stories in height and have spired roofs of black slate.

These towers were constructed to allow archers and wizards to command the bridge and the river wall.
