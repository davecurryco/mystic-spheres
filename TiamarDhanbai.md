## Actions

**Reverent Awe.** The mummified monk targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummified monk, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become paralyzed until the end of the mummified monk's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also deafened and blinded for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the _Reverent Awe_ of all mummified monks for the next 24 hours.
