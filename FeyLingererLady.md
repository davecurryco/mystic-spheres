**Despairing Presence.** At the start of each of the fey lingerer lady's turns, each creature within 10 feet of her must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the aura of despair that surrounds the lady. Affected creatures are stunned until the end of the fey lingerer's next turn. A creature that has saved against the effect or on which the effect has worn off is immune to the effect for 24 hours.

**Fey Sight.** The fey lingerer can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The fey lingerer can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Fey Ancestry.** The fey lingerer has advantage on saving throws against being charmed and magic can't put the fey lingerer to sleep.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The fey lingerer lady's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _true strike_
1/day each: _darkness, bane, hold person_

**Spellcasting.** The fey lingerer lady is a 10th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The fey lingerer lady has the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): _guidance, poison spray, resistance, thaumaturgy, vicious mockery_  
1st level (4 slots): _charm person, comprehend languages, ray of sickness, tasha's hideous laughter_  
2nd level (3 slots): _crown of madness, enthrall, detect thoughts, phantasmal force_
3rd level (3 slots): _bestow curse, dispel magic_  
4th level (3 slots): _confusion, divination_  
5th level (2 slots): _geas, modify memory_  

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the fey lingerer has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

**Freezing Touch.** _Melee Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (5d6) cold damage.

**Desparing Moan.** The fey lingerer lady utters a cry of desolate misery, provided she isn't in sunlight. The moan has no effect on constructs and undead. All other creatures within 30 feet of her that can hear her must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is incapacitated for one minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Fey Step.** The fey lingerer lady teleports up to 25 feet.

**Etherealness.** The fey lingerer enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is the Border Ethereal and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

**Fey Lingerers** are elves who have fallen into unforgivable, irredeemable evil and so have had the life of the Aelvii withdrawn from them. They do not dwell entirely in the mortal world, nor can they journey to Aelvalon. Fey lingerers are weakened by sunlight, so they commonly retreat to the Ethereal during the day.
