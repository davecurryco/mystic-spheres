# Iaellon

The great forest of Iaellon is the traditional domain of the elves. Except for a brave remnant who remained in Elanarion after the coming of Varog the Destroyer and her brood, the deep woods of Iaellon are the last refuge of the Illuvarin in Arestor.

## Geography

### Layout

_Iaellon_ extends along the east side of the _Tuelyacantii_ (Silver Mountains) from the Gate of Asarial in the south to the bay of _Denyessemanye_ in the north. The heart of Iaellon is the valley of the _Cuinilanya River_, which arises from a spring that issues from a grotto on the west side of _Oromonyecana_, the Mountain of the Moon, called _Kazad-Duerendar_ by the dwarves. The grotto is a fey crossing and the magic of Aelvalon is infused in the waters of the Cuinilanya. The river is cold and crystal clear along its entire length and all the valley is touched with the bright beauty of Elfland.

### The Alyaquende (dispossessed)

When Varog overthrew Laessinia, a large body of refugees renounced the effete ways of the Alastarii. Calling themselves the _Alyaquende_, they gathered under Ceredin the Dauntless, a resolute leader who had his kindred among the Tellyaellon. Ceredin led the refugees west. They were at first succored by the Illuvarin of Silyelin, but were later encouraged to move on. This experience was repeated with the Tellyaellon, but Ceredin prevailed on his kin to gain permission to reclaim the lands of southern Iaellon that had been vacated by the dwindling of the Tellyaellon. Embittered by the destruction of their homeland and their reduced status as wanderers, the newcomers expanded south, driving out the goblin tribes before them. In their cold fury, the elves even fell on parties of human loggers and trappers from Delastarion who had begun to exploit the east banks of the Celedonnin River and wiped them out to the last man.

Adopting by necessity the sylvan ways of their Elesanii kin, the elves under Ceredin live in a network of settlements among the forested hills of south Iaellon. Ceredin himself and his lady Caelynneth dwell in the hidden valley of Nintelanye - Gloamingdale as it is styled in Common. This was an ancient stronghold of the Illuvarin. Ceredin, vowing never again to fall into complacency and weakness, renewed its fortifications and wards. His scouts patrol the borders of the forest with orders to slay any goblins they encounter and capture any others who trespass within. The king has manipulated tribes of wood-woads to become guardians of the southern and eastern borders of his domain.

The Alyaquende's interests are not confined to the borders of their new lands. It was Ceredin who arranged for the kidnapping of King Allenar in exchange for the dissolution of the Borderers. Now that the Telenar have been driven out of their settlements north of the Shield Wall, the elf lord plans to destroy Bar-Krogroshir (Delastarion) and supplant the goblins in their turn. For her own part, Lady Caelynneth, little content with the simple forest life, dreams of breaking the Curse of Narastur, reclaiming the land of Asarial, and restoring the city to its former glory. The people of the Alyaquende desire to have revenge on the dragon and many of them hope to return to Laessinia some day. Ceredin plays to this, but he realizes that his people's drive and his own headship are products of the loss of their homeland. He and his lady are in no hurry to return while their newly-awakened ambitions are yet unfulfilled. Of course, the elves can afford to let their plans play out over the course of centuries now that their immediate needs for security have been met.

### The Tellyaellon

Iaellon east of the Cuinilanya River was the domain of the Tellyaellon, a kinship of Illuvarin of the Elesanii. In wars with the goblins and sadness at the fall of Asarial, their numbers dwindled until they held only central Iaellon east of the Cuinilanya River. They are xenophobic, but are not nearly as aggressive as the Alyaquende. Nevertheless, any party that trespasses in their domains had better be able to provide a good account of themselves and their business.

The Tellyaellon have no leaders who have the stature or drive to match Ceredin or Lady Caelynneth. Their elders meet individually and decide matters by consensus. Now that their southern borders are secure, they have already drifted back into complacency.

### The Angaladarin

The most numerous people of the Elesannii, the Angaladarin occupy all of Iaellon west of the Cuinilanya River. Most dwell in the forest itself, but some live in the hills and mountains in the south and west of their domain. The forest dwellers are numerous enough to populate cities built in harmony with their natural surroundings. The greatest of these is Filyalonn, which is built among the branches of a grove of ancient quendacalaesse trees of gigantic size atop a group of hills in the heart of their territory.

Secure in their borders, the Angaladarin are arrogant and complacent. Their patrols readily defend the Ford of Caeldaruin, which is the sole means to cross the Cuinilanya River from the south. The dwarves of Azenendhal hold the mountains to the west and, if there is little love between them and the Angaladarin, neither have there been open hostilities in this age.

The Angaladarin are ruled by the Council of Nine, male and female elders representing the various divisions of their people. The Council meets infrequently and decides matters even less frequently. The most prominent elders among the Council are Lord Tuereon, a venerable and wise leader, and Lady Nanyesse, a seer of considerable prowess.

### The Sannyonarii

A small population of Illuvarin of the Alastarii dwell in the town of Varandanye on the bay of Denyessemanye. These are the Sannyonarii, the Shipwrights, the last remnant of the sea-elves of old. These eldarin acknowledge the lordship of an elder, Ciriarin the Far-Traveled.

The Sannyonarii are insular, even for eldarin, as they are set apart by their seagoing way of life. They now fare mostly north and west to destinations they will not name to any save their Alastarii kindred.
