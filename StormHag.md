**Copper Cauldron Magic.** The hag rides in a large copper cauldron that is a focus for her inner power. The cauldron acts as a _broom of flying_ and while the hag is riding within it the cauldron will absorb one ranged weapon or spell attack targeted at the hag each round. In addition, if the hag is touching the cauldron she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk). If the cauldron is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a storm hag can use a copper cauldron in this way.

**Magic Weapons.** The hags's weapon attacks are magical.  

**Keen Sight.** The hag has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  

**Innate Spellcasting.** The hag's innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +8 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  

At will: _fog cloud, dancing lights, shocking grasp, thunderclap_  
3/day each: _feather fall, lightning bolt, thunder step, wind wall*_  
2/day each: _counterspell*, dispel magic*, ice storm_  
1/day each: _control weather, wind walk*, whirlwind*_

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hag makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.  

**Change Shape.** The hag magically polymorphs into a Medium female humanoid or a Large or Huge female giant, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

**Lightning Strike (Recharge 5-6).** The hag hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point she can see within 300 feet of her. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Storm Hag** Storm Hags live in the clouds or on high mountaintops, often in the guise of cloud or storm giantesses. In her true form, a storm hag's skin has a corpse-like pallor, her eyes gleam with a flickering, pale-blue light from within deep sockets, and her frizzy, grey-streaked hair stands at end.
