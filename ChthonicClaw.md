**Nimble Escape.** The claw can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

**Strangler's Attack.** Once per turn, the claw can deal an extra 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage to a creature it hits with its life-drain attack if that creature has been hit in the same round by another chthonic claw taken from the same murderer. 

**Turn Immunity.** The claw is immune to effects that turn undead.

## Actions

**Life Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Chthonic Claws** are the severed hands of murderers animated by a _chthonic_ school variant of the ritual that creates a crawling claw. Often, both of the murderer's hands are animated at the same time to produce a pair of claws that work in concert to strangle their victims.

_**Living Claws.**_ As with a crawling claw, a chthonic claw can be created from the severed hand of a still-living murderer. In such a case, the murderer must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw when it enters the coma caused by separation of its hand. On a failed save, echoes of the claw's gruesome deeds spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the murderer's sleep and prevents the murderer from gaining any benefit from that rest.
