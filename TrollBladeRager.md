**Keen Smell.** The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Regeneration.** The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Pounce.** If the troll moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a melee attack in the same turn, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled. If the target is grappled, the troll can use Rending Grapple against it as a bonus action.

**Berserk.** Whenever a bladerager starts its turn with 90 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the bladerager goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the  bladerager attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the bladerager makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the bladerager is no longer berserk. The berserk condition also ends if the bladerager regains all its hit points.

**Death Burst.** When the troll drops to 0 hit points, it explodes in a burst of gibbs and shrapnel. Creatures within 10 feet of the troll must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage or half as much damage on a success.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The troll makes three melee attacks, only one of which may be a Bite or Rending Grapple. If both claw attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the creature is grappled (Escape DC 16) and the bladerager uses its Rending Grapple on it, rather than a Bite.

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 14 (1d8 + 10) piercing damage.

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 32 (5d8 + 10) slashing damage.

**Rending Grapple.** The bladerager squeezes a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The target immediately takes 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. The target is also restrained, unable to breathe, and must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the start of each turn or take 12 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage.

**Bladerager Trolls** are specially-selected trolls enslaved and subjected to a cruel ritual that binds armor and weaponry into their living bodies. The pain of this invariably drives the troll insane. When a bladerager is killed, the enchantment ruptures violently, hurling bits of troll and shards of metal in all directions at high velocity. This kills the troll, even if it might otherwise be able to regenerate.

## Variant: Suicide Bladerager

Some bladeragers are enchanted with a special ritual that greatly increases the power of their Death Burst. Unleashed into combat, these trolls seek only to end their excruciating misery by hurling themselves at the nearest enemy, doing as much damage as possible in a single turn and then using Suicide Burst as a bonus action.

**Suicide Burst.** The troll willingly explodes, immediately killing itself. Creatures within 30 feet of the troll must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 55 (10d10) piercing damage or half as much damage on a success.
