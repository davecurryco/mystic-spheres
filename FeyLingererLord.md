**Menacing Presence.** At the start of each of the fey lingerer lord's turns, each creature within 10 feet of him must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the aura of menace that surrounds the lord. Affected creatures are frightened until the end of the fey lingerer's next turn. A creature that has saved against the effect or on which the effect has worn off is immune to the effect for 24 hours.

**Fey Sight.** The fey lingerer can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The fey lingerer can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Fey Ancestry.** The fey lingerer has advantage on saving throws against being charmed and magic can't put the fey lingerer to sleep.

At will: _true strike_

## Actions

**Multiattack.** The fey lingerer lord makes two longsword attacks or two glaive attacks.

**Glaive.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (1d10 + 6) slashing damage.

**Longsword.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.

**Life Drain.** As a bonus action, the fey lingerer lord can inflict 21 (4d8 +3) necrotic damage on a creature it has hit with a melee attack. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The fey lingerer lord gains temporary hit points equal to the reduction.

**Summon Spectre (3/day).** The fey lingerer lord magically summons a spectre. The summon spectre appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other spectres.It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

**Etherealness.** The fey lingerer enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is the Border Ethereal and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

**Fey Lingerers** are elves who have fallen into unforgivable, irredeemable evil and so have had the life of the Aelvii withdrawn from them. They do not dwell entirely in the mortal world, nor can they journey to Aelvalon. Fey lingerers are weakened by sunlight, so they commonly retreat to the Ethereal during the day.
