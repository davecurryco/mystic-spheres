**Shapechanger.** If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back to its true form (see MM for details).

**Legendary Resistance.** (3/day). If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Misty Escape.** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (see MM for details).

**Regeneration.** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.

**Spider Climb.** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Vampire Weaknesses.** _(See MM for details).)_

**Pact of the Thorn.** Tyriana's attacks and spells deal double weapon dice damage if the damage type is slashing or piercing. Her unarmed strike deals slashing damage, rather than the usual bludgeoning damage, and is considered to be both a pact weapon and a magical weapon. In addition, she gains the proprietary spells Hell Briar and Thorn Strike.

**Invisible in Shadows.** (with one with shadows). When Tyriana is in an area of dim light or darkness, she can use her action to become invisible until she moves or takes an action or reaction.

**Spellcasting.** Tyriana is an 12th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). She knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips: _eldritch blast, mage hand, minor illusion, true strike_  
1st level: _command, hex_  
2nd level: _hold person, scorching ray_  
3rd level: _dispel magic, major image_  
4th level: _hell briar, dimension door_  
5th level: _hallow, scrying, thorn strike_  

In addition, Tyriana knows the following Eldritch Invocations, with which she is imbued at all times:

_beguiling influence, devil's sight, gaze of two minds, lifedrinker, one with shadows, thirsting blade_

## Actions

**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).** The vampire makes two attacks (three with thirsting blade), only one of which can be a bite attack.

**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 12 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage (plus 5 necrotic damage with lifedrinker). Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.

**Charm.** The vampire targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed creature regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**Children of the Night (1/day).** The elven vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of umbral sprites (bats) or gremlins (rats), provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

## Legendary Actions

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Move.** The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Unarmed Strike.** The vampire makes one unarmed strike (two with thirsting blade).

**Bite (costs 2 actions).** The vampire makes one bite attack.

## Tyriana's Lair

Tyriana's lair is Blackfane Spire, a stronghold of her patron, Gothrog the Tyrant.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing ties) the vampire takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* Tyriana creates darkness as though she had cast the darkness spell. The darkness lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.

### Regional Effects

The mingling of fey magic with necrotic energy in the area of Tyriana's lair creates the following effects:

* Plants in the area grow wildly and may be transformed into blights. These creatures are under the control of Tyriana or any of her vampire spawn.
* Whenever a living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 100 feet of Tyriana's lair, she becomes aware of the creature’s presence and location.

**Tyriana** is an elven vampire, one of a very few cursed with the substitution of undeath for the life of the Aelvii. She appears as a strikingly-beautiful, but painfully thin, elven woman with long silver hair, pale skin and sunken cheeks. She typically wears a clinging gown of thin, dark-red silk with a deeply plunging neckline and slit hem that only serve to emphasize her emaciation. Her eyes burn with feral hunger and her voice is unnaturally deep and chill, like an echo from the grave. Those whom Tyriana holds in her gaze and engages with her speech find themselves drawn to her will.

Tyriana, whose name was _Alyenwe_, loved a mortal man, Darain, and for his sake cast aside the life of the Aelvii. Unfortunately, after Tyriana had borne him two daughters, Darain forsook her for a mortal woman, by whom he hoped to get a son. Deranged by this betrayal, Tyriana made an unthinkable pact with Azariel, a prince of the infernal planes. Wied in their blood, the depraved elf-woman subjected her husband to a slow death of many cuts. Tyriana then fled through a fey crossing to wander the wastes of Cymmyrion until she died of starvation.

The horrific, sanguine nature of her crimes, the condition of hunger in which she died, and the dark pact she had made combined with the ambient necrotic influence of Blightland to raise Tyriana as a vampire. Consumed with bloodlust, she and her vampire spawn soon became a menace, notorious even for Blightland. Thus she was when Gothrog found her and recruited her as his protege.
