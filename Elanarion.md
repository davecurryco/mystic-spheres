### The Lindelonye

The largest group of the Alastarii, called the _Lindelonye_, dwell in the mountain city of Silyelinn. They are ruled by a council of twenty-one elders called the _Fillyontende_ (Star-Guided). The destruction of Laessinia and the plight of the Alyaquende has certainly shaken the Lindelonye out of their previous complacency, but they lack the unity to establish a clear course of action to deal with the threat of the dragon. Factions have formed in the Fillyontende. One, led by Galdorian, urges war on the dragon. Another faction, of which Halrandir is the most vocal, advocates evacuating the country east of the _Callantilde_ (Icyflow) River and waiting the dragon out. Others are not so sure about either course and caution against taking any course of action until more information about the dragon and her motives can be obtained.

In the meantime, the Lindelonye have completely halted shipping in the bays of Iss-Melennion and Iss-Elderion after Varog destroyed several elven ships that she caught on open waters in the first few months of her occupation of Laseeinia. This was precisely Rashazer's purpose in recruiting the dragon to begin with and hobgoblin galleys now ply the south coast of the bays without fear of interference.
