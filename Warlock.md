### Pact of the Eye

Your archfey patron grants you mystic insight into the fey realm. When you gain this feature, chose three cantrips from the Druid spell list. You can cast these cantrips at will. They don't count against your cantrips known. In addition, you gain access to the proprietary spell _Stank Eye_.
